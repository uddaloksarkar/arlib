# Arlib

A curated, **mathlib-style** library of reusable Lean 4 + Mathlib results,
distilled from the meelgroup formalization projects. The goal is a single,
clean, `sorry`-free library that others can `import` and build on — rather than
re-proving the same infrastructure in every new project.


## Design philosophy

Emulating Mathlib: general, reusable content lives here under a single root
namespace (`Arlib`), organized by mathematical area, with docstrings and a root
module that re-exports everything. Project-specific *capstone* theorems (the
correctness proof of a particular algorithm) stay in their own repositories;
Arlib holds the **general lemmas underneath them** that are worth sharing.

Each area is a directory `Arlib/<Area>/` with an area root `Arlib/<Area>.lean`
that re-exports the area's modules. The library root `Arlib.lean` re-exports all
area roots, so `import Arlib` gives you everything and `import Arlib.Probability`
gives you one area.


## Build

Pinned to **Lean `v4.15.0`** and **Mathlib `v4.15.0`** (same as the source
projects, so material migrates with zero porting).

```bash
lake exe cache get   # fetch prebuilt Mathlib oleans (don't compile Mathlib from source)
lake build           # builds everything; the root re-exports every area
```

`import Arlib` in your own file to use the library.



## Layout

```
arlib/                    # repo folder (Lake package name stays lowercase)
  lean-toolchain          # leanprover/lean4:v4.15.0
  lakefile.toml           # requires mathlib @ v4.15.0
  Arlib.lean              # library root — re-exports every area
  Arlib/
    Prelude.lean
    Probability.lean      # area root — re-exports the modules below
