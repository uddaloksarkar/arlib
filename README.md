# Arlib

A curated, **mathlib-style** library of reusable Lean 4 + Mathlib results,
distilled from the meelgroup formalization projects. The goal is a single,
clean, `sorry`-free library that others can `import` and build on — rather than
re-proving the same infrastructure in every new project.

> **Status.** Early. The first area — finite/discrete **probability** — is
> migrated, building green, and axiom-clean. More areas follow (see
> [Roadmap](#roadmap)).

## Design philosophy

Emulating Mathlib: general, reusable content lives here under a single root
namespace (`Arlib`), organized by mathematical area, with docstrings and a root
module that re-exports everything. Project-specific *capstone* theorems (the
correctness proof of a particular algorithm) stay in their own repositories;
Arlib holds the **general lemmas underneath them** that are worth sharing.

Each area is a directory `Arlib/<Area>/` with an area root `Arlib/<Area>.lean`
that re-exports the area's modules. The library root `Arlib.lean` re-exports all
area roots, so `import Arlib` gives you everything and `import Arlib.Probability`
gives you one area.

## What's here

### `Arlib.Probability` — finite/discrete probability

25 modules, ~5.3k LOC, ~220 lemmas/theorems, 40 definitions/structures. Finite
probability spaces and the machinery built on them:

| Module | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `FinProb`, `ProbSpace` | Finite probability space; mass/probability; `Pr` (incl. disjoint-union additivity, complement), expectation `Ex`. |
| `Markov` | Linearity of expectation, **Markov's inequality**, variance (`Var`, `Var_eq`), **Chebyshev**. |
| `Conditioning` | Conditioning a `FinProb` on an event: `cond`, conditional `Pr`/`Ex`. |
| `Median`, `FirstBad` | Median-of-means amplification; first-failure decomposition. |
| `IntersectionTailBound` | Tail bound for an intersection of events. |
| `Independence`, `CoordIndep` | Independence of events and of coordinates. |
| `CondExp`, `CondExpConstruction`, `CondExpLinear` | Conditional expectation interface (fixed-variable + tower rules) and its concrete construction; linearity. |
| `ProductSpace`, `RunProduct`, `UniformCoin` | Product probability spaces; independent-runs product; uniform coin/grid model. |
| `CondExpProd`, `CondExpProdData`, `ReduceModel` | Conditional expectation over product spaces; model reduction. |
| `ContCoinProto`, `MixedCoinSpace`, `MixedRunProduct`, `MixedCoordIndep`, `MixedCondCELinear`, `MixedCondProd` | Continuous/mixed coin protocol and the mixed (continuous × discrete) product space and its independence / conditional-expectation algebra. |
| `ProbSpaceValidation` | Sanity/validation lemmas for the space axioms. |

### `Arlib.Combinatorics` — generic `Finset` / `List` helpers

Fully generic (`[DecidableEq α]` / `[LinearOrder α]`) helper lemmas that recurred
across several projects but are not in Mathlib under an obvious name.

| Module | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `Combinatorics.Finset` | Membership in a list-fold union (`mem_foldr_union`, `mem_foldr_union_map`); powerset of a union as an image of a product (`image_union_powerset`); recovering a summand of a disjoint union (`union_inter_left`/`right`); tiling an interval by consecutive blocks (`Ico_biUnion_blocks`); a concatenation counting bound `|A|·|B| ≤ |C|` (`concat_injOn`, `card_mul_le_of_concat_subset`). |
| `Combinatorics.BigOperators` | Diagonal/off-diagonal split of a double sum (`sum_matrix_diag_offdiag`); products of an idempotent function over subsets/unions/`biUnion`s (`prod_mul_prod_subset`, `prod_union_idem`, `prod_biUnion_idem`); a surjection–product inequality (`prod_le_prod_comp_of_surj`); products of `{0,1}`-valued functions (`prod_zero_or_one`, `zo_prod_eq_one_iff`). |
| `Combinatorics.ListFold` | Upper/lower bounds for `List.foldr min` (`foldr_min_le_init`, `foldr_min_le_mem`, `le_foldr_min`, `lt_foldr_min`). |

### `Arlib.MarkovChains` — finite Markov chains

53 modules, ~25.5k LOC, split by a load-bearing design principle: `Techniques/` holds
machinery valid for *any* finite chain, `Chains/` holds the analysis of *specific* chains,
and every general definition is instantiated against a concrete chain that keeps it honest.
Following the Chen–Štefankovič–Vigoda monograph on spectral independence (`source/main.tex`).

The area's defining commitment: **the spectral gap is defined variationally**, by the
Poincaré inequality `γ·Var_μ(f) ≤ ℰ_P(f)`, and eigenvalues never appear — not in a
statement, not in a proof. Every step a textbook takes via the spectral theorem is taken
here by an elementary variational, discriminant, or adjointness argument.

| Module | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `Techniques.Chain` | `FinDist`, `FinKernel` (rectangular, so the up/down operators of the local-to-global machinery fit), `FinChain`, `act`/`push`, composition, iteration, `Stationary`, `Reversible`. |
| `Techniques.Bilinear` | Cauchy–Schwarz for a PSD symmetric bilinear form, by the discriminant trick rather than by eigenvalues. |
| `Techniques.Functional` | The `L²(μ)` calculus: `Ex`, `ip`, `Var`, the pair form of the variance, `relDensity`, `chiSq`. |
| `Techniques.Dirichlet` | The Dirichlet form and its pair form; the two-sided bound `\|⟪f,Pf⟫_μ\| ≤ ⟪f,f⟫_μ`; reversibility as self-adjointness; `SpectralGapAtLeast` (Poincaré) and `NonnegDefinite` (PSD). |
| `Techniques.SpectralGap` | From the numerical-range bound to the operator bound `⟪Pf,Pf⟫ ≤ c²⟪f,f⟫`; geometric decay of variance and of χ²-divergence. |
| `Techniques.TotalVariation` | TV distance, its event characterisation, the data-processing inequality, mixing time, and `(2·d_TV)² ≤ χ²`. |
| `Techniques.MixingTime` | Point masses, χ² decay along the chain, and the assembled bound `T_mix(ε) ≤ (2/γ)·ln(1/(2ε√μ_min))`. |
| `Techniques.Lazy` | The lazy chain `½(I+P)`: one source of PSD chains, and the capstone `Var_μ(P_lazy^t f) ≤ (1−γ/2)^{2t} Var_μ(f)`. |
| `Techniques.Mixture` | Convex combinations of kernels — two-way, uniform average, general weights — and the inheritance of stationarity, reversibility, PSD and the gap. |
| `Techniques.Adjoint` | Mutually adjoint kernel pairs `μ(x)K(x,y) = ν(y)L(y,x)`; composites are reversible **and** PSD for free. `Reversible` is the self-adjoint case. |
| `Techniques.Levels` | The up and down walks on the levels of a weighted complex, their adjointness, and hence reversibility, stationarity and PSD of the up-down and down-up walks. |
| `Techniques.LocalWalk` | Links of a face — again weighted complexes, so `Levels` applies verbatim — the one-level-up distribution, and the local walk with its reversibility. |
| `Techniques.Entropy` | The entropy functional `Ent_μ(f)`, the modified log-Sobolev inequality, entropy decay along a chain, and KL divergence with its contraction. |
| `Techniques.Comparison` | Comparison of Dirichlet forms and transfer of the spectral gap; off-diagonal domination suffices; the absolute bound for iterates. |
| `Techniques.Conductance` | Ergodic flow, cut, conductance; `ℰ_P(1_A) = cut`; the easy direction of Cheeger's inequality. |
| `Techniques.Coupling` | Couplings, the coupling inequality, and the maximal coupling — so TV distance *is* the minimum disagreement probability. |
| `Techniques.LevelVariance` | The law of total variance for a bare kernel — no hypotheses — and hence the local-to-global step `Var_{π_{k+1}}(g) = Var_{π_k}(Ug) + ℰ_{downUp}(g)` as an *identity*. |
| `Techniques.LocalToGlobal` | Telescoping that identity down the levels: `Var_{π_n}(f) = Σ_{k<n} ℰ_{downUp_k}(f^{(k+1)})`, exactly — `π_0` is a point mass, so there is no leading term. Includes the guarded link distribution the sum needs. |
| `Techniques.LinkRestriction` | A closed form for the level projections — `f^{(k)}(τ)` is the conditional expectation given `σ ⊇ τ` — and their compatibility with restriction to a link. Separates the *star* of a face (what `LocalWalk.linkWeight` builds) from the link proper; they agree at level one, audited against `linkDist`. |
| `Techniques.FirstStep` | `claim:first-step` — the two-level variance drop equals the average over faces of the variance inside the two-levels-up link. Needs no WLOG centering (the squared means cancel by a pushforward identity), and the crux is the factor `2·(n−k).choose 2 = (n−k)(n−k−1)` relating the link to two applications of the up operator. |
| `Techniques.ImprovedRandomWalk` | `lem:improved-technical` and the Improved Random Walk Theorem — per-link Poincaré inequalities give the top-level down-up walk a gap of `Γ_m / ∑_{i≤m} Γ_i`, with `Γ_i = ∏_{j<i}(2γ_j − 1)`. The monograph's induction tacitly needs `2γ_j ≥ 1`, which is why the theorem is stated in those factors at all; here it is an explicit hypothesis. |
| `Techniques.LocalWalkBridge` | `P^∧∨_{τ,1} = (Q_τ + I)/2` — an entrywise identity on *every* row, degenerate ones included, because the two constructions' guards are literally the same predicate. Hence `γ(P^∧∨_{τ,1}) ≥ γ/2 ↔ γ(Q_τ) ≥ γ`, exact in both directions, and the Random Walk Theorem restated on `Q_τ`. |
| `Techniques.MultiStep` | `Adjoint.comp` — adjointness composes, with the order reversed on one side — hence multi-step operators between any two levels, `lem:diff-var` for general `i > j`, and the multi-level `eqn:RW-improved-general`. `multiDownUp_succ` audits the orientation against `Levels.downUp`. |
| `Techniques.UpDownDownUp` | Equal Poincaré constants for the two composites of an adjoint pair (`lem:updown-downup`), where the monograph uses equality of the nonzero spectra of `AB` and `BA`. The `γ ≤ 1` side condition is *necessary* — a point-mass source satisfies every Poincaré inequality vacuously — and the counterexample is formalized. |
| `Techniques.Transport` | μ-almost-everywhere agreement of chains, and transport of the whole `L²` theory along an injective embedding of state spaces. Rows of weight zero are invisible; the range carries all the mass. |
| `Techniques.Pinsker` | `2·d_TV² ≤ D_KL`, sharp constant, by a pointwise Padé bound plus tangent-line linearisation — no marginalisation and no square roots. Absolute continuity is required, not cosmetic: without it disjoint point masses give `klDiv = 0` and `tvDist = 1`. Chaining it after `klDiv_le_chiSq` is *worse* than the direct χ² bound by `√2`, so it pays only on KL bounds of entropy origin. |
| `Techniques.EntropyDecay` | `EntropyContraction` — the right hypothesis for geometric entropy decay — giving `D_KL ≤ ε` after `Θ(ρ⁻¹ log log(1/μ_min))` steps, against the χ² route's `Θ(γ⁻¹ log(1/μ_min))`. And the refutation: an MLSI does *not* imply decay (`exists_modLogSobolev_not_entropyContraction`; the deterministic swap on `Bool` has `ρ = 1` and constant entropy), because `Ent(f) − Ent(Pf) ≥ ℰ(f, log f)` forces `Pf = f`. |
| `Techniques.EntropyVariational` | Young's inequality for entropy, the Gibbs variational principle, `Ent ≤ Var/E`, and hence `KL ≤ χ²`. |
| `Techniques.PsdOrder` | Quadratic forms of a plain `ι → ι → ℝ` and the PSD ordering `PsdLe`. No `Matrix`, no spectrum, no eigenvalues. |
| `Techniques.SpectralIndependence` | The covariance form with `quadForm (Cov μ) a = Var μ (fun σ => ∑ v, a (v, σ v))`, so PSD-ness of `Cov` is a corollary of `Var_nonneg`; spectral independence **defined** as the ordering `Cov ⪯ η·diag(marg)` — the eigenvalue-free equivalent of `λ_max(Ψ) ≤ η`. |
| `Techniques.LocalSpectralIndependence` | Spectral independence ⟹ a Poincaré inequality for the local walk at any pinning, via the exact identity `ℰ_Q(f) = m/(m−1)·Var_π(f) − quadForm(Cov μ) f̃/(m(m−1))`. The monograph's `lem:QandPsi`, proved there with `λ_max(Ψ)` and a block-matrix argument; here with neither. |
| `Chains.Metropolis` | Metropolis–Hastings: manufacturing a chain reversible with respect to a prescribed target. |
| `Chains.TwoState` | The two-state chain computed exactly — gap, contraction factor and Dirichlet form as identities — then plugged back into the general predicates, and used to audit the Cheeger bound. |
| `Chains.IndependentSampler` | The `P(x,y) = μ(y)` chain: Dirichlet form = variance, gap exactly `1`, mixes in one step. The library's best case. |
| `Chains.SpinSystem` | Configurations, single-site updates, the Gibbs distribution and its local partition functions; the hard-core model. |
| `Chains.Glauber` | The Glauber dynamics: single-site heat-bath updates, reversibility w.r.t. Gibbs, and positive semidefiniteness via self-adjoint idempotence. |
| `Chains.Pinning` | Pinnings and conditional Gibbs measures; the single-site update recovered as "resample from the conditional distribution". |
| `Chains.BlockDynamics` | Heat-bath block dynamics; reversibility and PSD for a single block, inherited by the mixture; Glauber is the singleton-block case. |
| `Chains.GlauberTensorization` | The Dirichlet form of the Glauber dynamics as a mean conditional variance, and approximate tensorization of variance as an equivalent of the spectral gap. |
| `Chains.LevelEncoding` | Spin systems as weighted complexes; the down-up walk at the top level *is* the Glauber dynamics. |
| `Chains.GlauberViaLevels` | Transporting that encoding back: PSD-ness of the Glauber dynamics derived a third time, now from adjointness, and the Poincaré inequality transferred in both directions. |
| `Chains.PinnedGlauber` | Conditioning does not leave the category: pinned marginals, `π_{η,1}`, and the local walk `Q_η` — shown to be the complex-side `localWalk` entry for entry. |
| `Chains.UniformComplex` | The concrete instantiation the `Levels`/`LocalWalk` development lacked: `mu`, `π_k` (uniform, and *independent of the dimension*), `U_k = 1/(N−k)`, and `downUp` as the Bernoulli–Laplace walk in closed form. Audits the general theory against exact answers — detailed balance proved twice, the Rayleigh quotient exactly `N/((k+1)(N−k))`, and `ℰ ≤ Var` shown tight at `k = 0` with its slack computed above. |
| `Chains.BernoulliLaplace` | The first non-trivial Poincaré inequality here, and the first end-to-end use of local-to-global: `γ ≥ (N+1)/((N+1−d)(d+1))`, with the local input `γ(Q_τ) = M/(M−1)` discharged as an identity. Audited against the exact `N/((d+1)(N−d))`: the relative loss is `1 − d/(N(N+1−d))`, all of it in the assembly, and quadratic in the local gap's excess over 1. |
| `Chains.ProductMeasure` | The first weight for which approximate tensorization is *proved*, discharging the hypothesis the `GlauberTensorization` equivalences were built to consume: a product measure gives `C = 1`, hence Glauber gap exactly `1/n`. The induction needs no site ordering — proving it for every `Λ` at once makes it monotone, so plain `Finset.induction_on` closes it. |
| `Chains.ProductOptimalMixing` | `O(n log(n/ε))` mixing in relative entropy for product-measure Glauber — the monograph's headline claim. The comparison is made honestly: the variance route is `Θ(n²)` here, since `log(1/√m) = Θ(n)`, and the baseline is restated without laziness first, because Glauber is already PSD. KL only; no TV bound at this rate is claimed. |
| `Chains.SpectralIndependenceMixing` | **The monograph's central theorem.** Spectral independence at every pinning ⟹ a spectral gap for Glauber, chaining `LocalSpectralIndependence` → `PinnedGlauber` → `LocalWalkBridge` → `ImprovedRandomWalk` → `GlauberViaLevels`. Exactly `1/n` at `η = 1`, matching the product-measure answer with no slack. The `η ≤ 3/2` hypothesis is an artefact of our `ImprovedRandomWalk`, not of the mathematics. |
| `Chains.ProductSpectralIndependence` | Discharges the central theorem's hypothesis for the first time. Pairwise independence of a product weight is the *unnormalised* identity `Z(pin{v,u})·Z = Z(pin{v})·Z(pin{u})` — no division, no positivity needed, which matters because pinned families carry point masses. Yields `γ ≥ 1/n` via spectral independence: literally the same proposition `ProductMeasure` proves via tensorization. |
| `Chains.OptimalMixingTV` | `O(n log(n/δ))` for product Glauber in **total variation**. Pinsker's real cost is not a constant in a log but the squaring `δ ↦ δ²`, which halves the effective decay rate `ρ ↦ ρ/2`; the χ² route has no analogue. Proves the exact crossover: entropy beats variance iff `ln(nL/δ) < nL/2`, so neither dominates. |
| `Chains.ProductEntropy` | Tensorization of *entropy* for a product measure at `C = 1`, and the library's first modified log-Sobolev instance, `ModLogSobolev μ (glauber …) (1/n)` — stated against `entropyProduction`, never the vacuous naive form. Includes `localEnt_le_entropyProduction`, valid for any reversible chain. |
| `Chains.HardCore` | The monograph's two running examples. Hard-core, whose weight can vanish, with the exact `Zloc` trichotomy and the `λ/(1+λ)` update; and Ising, whose weight cannot, so `0 < Z` needs no hypothesis at all. |

### `Arlib.Prelude`

Small shared notation, currently the multiplicative **relative-error interval**
`relErr ε b = [(1-ε)·b, (1+ε)·b]` and `mem_relErr`.

## Build

Pinned to **Lean `v4.15.0`** and **Mathlib `v4.15.0`** (same as the source
projects, so material migrates with zero porting).

```bash
lake exe cache get   # fetch prebuilt Mathlib oleans (don't compile Mathlib from source)
lake build           # builds everything; the root re-exports every area
```

`import Arlib` in your own file to use the library.

## Verifying "done" (axiom hygiene)

Arlib holds itself to the project standard: `sorry`-free and axiom-clean. Every
result depends only on Mathlib's three foundational axioms.

```bash
lake build   # must emit zero `declaration uses 'sorry'` warnings
```

```lean
import Arlib
#print axioms Arlib.FinProb.markov
-- 'Arlib.FinProb.markov' depends on axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
```

Anything other than `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (a `sorryAx` or a
stray custom axiom) means a result is not actually proved.
