# Arlib.Automata

Finite automata, and lower bounds on the number of states they need.

The development follows Mika Göös, Stefan Kiefer and Weiqiang Yuan, *Lower
Bounds for Unambiguous Automata via Communication Complexity* (ICALP 2022), in
`source/kc/goos/`.  The paper proves three blowup theorems about *unambiguous*
finite automata — automata with at most one accepting run per word — and it
proves all three by translating them into communication complexity.

## Why this area depends on `Arlib.KnowledgeCompilation`

The translation is the point of the paper, so the communication-complexity
machinery is not incidental here: it is where the content lives.  That machinery
already existed in this library, in `Arlib.KnowledgeCompilation.Communication`,
because the knowledge-compilation area was built on the same tools — indeed on
this very paper, which it cites as an imported result.  Two of its files,
`Communication.ConicalJunta` and `Communication.NonnegRank`, contain
Göös–Kiefer–Yuan's own Lemma 14 and the inequality `Par₁ ≥ rk⁺`, both proved.

So `Arlib.Automata` imports from `Arlib.KnowledgeCompilation` rather than
duplicating it.  If the dependency ever becomes awkward, the fix is to promote
`Communication/` to an area of its own that both depend on; nothing in either
area would have to change apart from module names.

## The two models of a two-party function

The area uses `Communication.TwoParty`, which is rectangles and covers for a
bare `F : X → Y → Bool` on arbitrary types, rather than `Communication.Rectangle`,
which fixes a partition of a *variable set*.  An automaton reads a word and the
split is at a *position*: Alice holds a prefix, Bob a suffix.  A variable
partition of a Boolean cube is the wrong shape for that, and it is the wrong
shape again for sparse set disjointness, where the two sides are the `k`-subsets
of `[n]` and there is no ambient cube at all.

`Automata.WordCoding` is the bridge between the two, and it is a step the paper
never takes: the lifting theorems are stated for a variable partition, in which
Alice's variables are *not* a contiguous block of word positions.

## Modules

* `Automata.Basic` — NFA, DFA and UFA; runs as objects rather than endpoints,
  which is what makes unambiguity statable at all; `IsRun`, `isRun_append`,
  `Reach`, `Accepts`, `Unambiguous`, and DFA ⊆ UFA.
* `Automata.Simulation` — the folklore lemmas `lem: NFA-CC` and `lem: UFA-CC`:
  an NFA with `s` states gives `Cov₁(F) ≤ s`, and a UFA gives `Par₁(F) ≤ s`.
  The second is *not* proved "the same way" as the first, contrary to the
  paper; see the module docstring.
* `Automata.DNFtoUFA` — an unambiguous `k`-DNF with `ℓ` terms over `n` variables
  compiled to a UFA with exactly `ℓ·(n+1)` states.  Unambiguity of the automaton
  needs uniqueness of the term *index*, not of the term, which is where the
  counting form of `DNF.Unambiguous` earns its keep.
* `Automata.WordCoding` — the coding between gadget variables and split words,
  and the transport of a lower bound between the two models.
* `Automata.Imported` — Balodis et al.'s unambiguous-DNF-versus-CNF-width
  separation and Göös's non-deterministic lifting theorem, as inhabited
  hypothesis bundles rather than axioms.
* `Automata.Complement` — `thm: complement`: a language with a small UFA whose
  complement needs a large NFA.  The paper's product with a length counter turns
  out to be unnecessary here.
* `Automata.Union` — `thm: union` and `thm: or`: two languages with small UFAs
  whose union needs a large UFA.  Conditional on the same two bundles as the
  knowledge-compilation area's union theorem, and on nothing else.
* `Automata.Disjointness` — `thm: separation`, via sparse set disjointness.
  Razborov's covering-set lemma is proved by counting, with an explicit family
  size; the full-rank fact about the `k`-uniform disjointness matrix is imported,
  since it is Gottlieb-type inclusion-matrix nonsingularity.
* `Automata.ErrorReduction` — the upper-bound half of `thm: error`: approximate
  non-negative rank admits no efficient error reduction, because `∨` is easy to
  approximate at error `1/4` and hard at error `10⁻⁵`.

## Tree automata

The area also carries the *tree* automaton model, which shares nothing with the
communication-complexity development above and is used by the approximate
counting projects rather than by the lower bounds.

* `Automata.TreeAutomaton` — finite `Γ`-labelled **unranked ordered** trees
  `LTree Γ` with their size and eliminator, and nondeterministic **top-down**
  tree automata over them: `init : S → Prop` and `step : S → Γ → List S → Prop`,
  matching the shape `Δ ⊆ S × Σ × S*` in which a tree decomposition produces an
  automaton.  Acceptance is an inductive predicate whose children condition is
  a `List.Forall₂`, so no termination argument and no length side condition
  appear.  Includes the language `L(A)`, the `n`-slice `L_n(A)` that a counting
  problem asks about, and `LTree.attachMap`, which relabels every node by a
  function of the subtree rooted there — the shape a reduction needs when the
  label it writes at a node depends on which node it is.
* `Automata.TreeAutomatonOps` — two normalising constructions that the source
  papers assert without proof.  `singleInit` collapses a *set* of initial states
  to one fresh state at the cost of copying the root transitions, and is proved
  to preserve the language *and every size slice*, which is what a parsimonious
  reduction needs.  `LTree.toBinary` is the first-child/next-sibling
  (`@`-extension) encoding of an unranked tree as a binary tree over `Γ ⊕ Unit`,
  with its decoder `LTree.ofBinary`, the resulting `Equiv` onto the decodable
  binary trees, and the size identity `|toBinary t| = 2·|t| − 1` — the
  reparameterisation under which the TATA reduction is parsimonious, and which
  does not fit the papers' own definition of that word.
* `Automata.TreeAutomatonFinite` — the finiteness side conditions that the
  source papers fold into the phrase "a tree automaton `(S, Σ, Δ, s_init)`" and
  that the model above deliberately omits: `TreeAutomaton.IsFinite A k` asks for
  finitely many *reachable* states, a finite *used* alphabet, and branching
  degree `≤ k` at reachable states.  The reachability qualification is forced,
  not cosmetic — for an automaton whose states carry an ambient tree, the
  unqualified arity bound is false at every `k`.  `TreeAutomaton.restrict`
  re-indexes onto `↥A.reachableStates`, where the bound *does* hold at every
  state of the type, and preserves every size slice; `IsFinite.langOfSize_finite`
  is then the finiteness of `L_n(A)` that a counting problem needs, and it needs
  no decidability hypotheses at all.
* `Automata.TreeAutomatonBinarize` — the unranked-to-binary reduction, lifted
  from trees to *automata*: states `S ⊕ (Γ × List S)`, alphabet `Γ ⊕ Unit` with
  `Sum.inr ()` playing the `@` of the TATA construction, and the spine peeling
  the comb from the right.  `ncard_langOfSize_binarize` is the counting identity
  `|L_{2n−1}(binarize A)| = |L_n(A)|` that the source papers cite to `[tata2007]`
  without proof; `isFPRAS_of_binary` / `isFPAUS_of_binary` transport both
  guarantees along it.  The decoding — which those papers assert can be done in
  polynomial time and never argue — is the proved bijection `finsetEncodeEquiv`,
  whose inverse is literally `LTree.ofBinary`, not `Classical.choice`.  Two
  incidentals: the usual side condition `n ≥ 1` is unnecessary (both slices are
  empty at `n = 0`), and `odd_size_toBinary` settles the question of whether an
  encoded tree always has odd size — it does.
* `Automata.TreeAutomatonRelabel` — the alphabet re-indexing that
  `TreeAutomatonFinite` declines to do, because `LTree.mapLabel` changes the
  *type* of the trees, so the two slices compare by a bijection and never by an
  equality: `bijOn_langOfSize_relabelTo`, injective because `mapLabel` of an
  injection is, and surjective because `labelsIn_of_mem_langOfSize` forbids an
  accepted tree any label outside `A.usedLabels`.  `accepts_relabelTo_iff`
  transports acceptance both ways with no finiteness hypothesis at all.
  `presentation A` is the source papers' tuple `(S, Σ, Δ, S₀)` on two carriers
  that are now genuinely finite types — `restrict` composed with `relabelTo` —
  and `ncard_langOfSize_presentation` is the statement that it counts the same
  thing at every `n`.
* `Automata.SuccinctNFA` — NFAs whose transitions are labelled by *sets*, given
  by an abstract representation type with a decoding map rather than by
  `Set Γ` itself.  That is forced, not stylistic: the whole point of the model
  is that `|A|` is exponential in the representation size `‖A‖`, and a `Set Γ`
  carries no representation and hence no `‖·‖`.  Carries `W(s)` (the language
  ending at `s`), its recurrence `W_eq` — and the corrected base case
  `W(s_init) = {λ}`, `N(s_init) = 1`.  A source paper asserts `W(s_init) = ∅`;
  `W_init_nonempty` shows that is unsatisfiable and
  `W_eq_empty_of_W_init_eq_empty` shows it would collapse every `W(s)` to empty.
  `IsUnrolled` is the **graded** condition `lvl s = lvl s' + 1`, strictly
  stronger than the literal "levels strictly decrease" — and the strengthening
  is needed, since only grading makes all runs between two states equally long.
* `Automata.SuccinctNFAMembership` — deciding `w ∈ W(s)` by forward reachability,
  with an explicit cost model.  The bound `O(|Δ|·T)` holds — with **no** `|w|`
  factor — precisely because the automaton is unrolled: the frontier after `i`
  symbols sits entirely at one level, so distinct steps scan disjoint subsets of
  `Δ` and the sum telescopes.  Needs only `DecidableEq S`; decidability of
  `a ∈ decode A` comes from the `def:prop` membership oracle.
* `Automata.SuccinctNFAWitness` — models for the two hypothesis bundles the
  succinct-NFA development runs on, `Encoding` and `def:prop`'s `LabelProps`,
  which otherwise sit to the left of every turnstile with nothing known to
  satisfy them.  The witness is chosen to *bite*: its used label decodes to two
  distinct symbols and its sampler is deliberately non-uniform, sitting on both
  endpoints of the `(1 ± ε₀)` window, so `sampler_uniform` is an equality
  constraint rather than `p = p`; `labelProps_witness_le_eps/_g/_T` prove no
  smaller `ε₀`, `g` or `T` works.  It also settles why
  `LabelProps.sampler_mem` needs its `(N.decode A).Nonempty` guard: a `PMF` has
  nonempty support, so the unguarded clause *asserts* `A ≠ ∅`, and
  `not_unguarded_sampler_mem_dead` shows it admits no oracle at all on an
  automaton with a dead transition — which `labelProps_dead` then satisfies once
  the guard is in place.
