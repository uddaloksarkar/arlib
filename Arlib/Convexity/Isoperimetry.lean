# Isoperimetry for log-concave measures: the elementary reductions

An *isoperimetric inequality* for a measure `π` on a metric space bounds the mass of the
"middle" set `S₃` of a partition below, in terms of the separation between `S₁` and `S₂`:

  `π(S₃) ≥ c · d(S₁,S₂) · π(S₁) · π(S₂)`.

Such bounds are what lower-bound the **conductance** of a random walk, and hence its
mixing time; they are the geometric input to every log-concave sampling analysis
(Lovász–Simonovits, Kannan–Lovász–Simonovits, and the volume algorithms built on them).

## What this file proves

The **product-to-minimum conversion**. The inequality above is naturally proved in
*product* form `π S₁ · π S₂`, but conductance arguments consume it in *minimum* form
`min (π S₁) (π S₂)`. `Arlib.min_le_of_prod_le` is that conversion, and it is exact
arithmetic on a partition of unit mass — no measure theory, no geometry, so it is reusable
for any partition-based expansion argument (graph conductance, Cheeger-type bounds,
Markov-chain expansion).

It is the step Kannan–Lovász–Simonovits perform in one line, and the constant it produces,
`c / (2 + c)`, is the one the literature quotes.

## What this file does NOT prove

The isoperimetric inequality itself. The one-dimensional case for log-concave densities
(KLS95, Theorem 5.1) is a genuine theorem whose proof is not here, and the
`n`-dimensional case reduces to it only via the Lovász–Simonovits localization lemma.
Neither is available in Mathlib. `Arlib.OneDimIsoperimetry` states the one-dimensional
inequality as an explicit interface so that consumers can be written against it now and it
can be discharged later.

## Main results

* `Arlib.min_le_of_prod_le` — product form implies minimum form, with constant `c/(2+c)`.
* `Arlib.OneDimIsoperimetry` — the one-dimensional inequality, as an interface.
* `Arlib.OneDimIsoperimetry.min_form` — its minimum-form consequence.

/-- **Product form implies minimum form.**

If three nonnegative numbers summing to `1` satisfy `c · p₁ · p₂ ≤ p₃`, then
`(c / (2 + c)) · min p₁ p₂ ≤ p₃`.

This is the step that turns an isoperimetric bound stated as a *product* of the two side
masses into the *minimum* form that conductance arguments use. The constant `c/(2+c)` is
sharp for this derivation: the worst case is `p₁ = p₂ = 1/2`.

Purely arithmetic, so it applies to any partition of unit mass — a measure-theoretic
partition, a vertex partition of a graph, or the state space of a Markov chain. -/

/-- **The one-dimensional isoperimetric inequality for log-concave densities**
(Kannan–Lovász–Simonovits 1995, Theorem 5.1), as an interface.

`π` assigns mass to subsets of `ℝ`; `sep` is a lower bound on the distance between the two
outer sets of the partition. The field `iso` is the inequality itself.

**This is an assumption, not a theorem** — see the file docstring. It is stated here so
that conductance arguments can be written against it and it can be discharged by a future
formalization without changing its consumers. The intended instance is the normalized
measure of an isotropic log-concave density (`Arlib.LogConcave`). -/

/-- **The minimum form of the isoperimetric inequality**, which is what a conductance
argument consumes: the middle set carries mass at least a constant multiple of the smaller
side.

The constant degrades from `c · sep` to `(c · sep) / (2 + c · sep)` — the price of the
product-to-minimum conversion. -/
