# Log-concave functions on `ℝ`

Mathlib (`v4.15`) has no notion of log-concavity, so this file introduces one in the
multiplicative form the convex-geometry literature uses:

  `f((1−t)x + ty) ≥ f(x)^(1−t) · f(y)^t`.

This is the hypothesis under which the isoperimetric inequality of
`Arlib.Convexity.Isoperimetry` is stated, and it is the form in which the
Lovász–Simonovits / Kannan–Lovász–Simonovits results are quoted.

Stated with `Real.rpow` rather than `Monotone`/`ConvexOn (-log f)` so that it applies to
functions with zeros — which is essential, since the densities of interest are supported
on a bounded body and vanish outside it.

## Main definitions

* `Arlib.LogConcave` — the multiplicative inequality above.

## Main results

* `Arlib.LogConcave.mul` — a product of log-concave functions is log-concave. This is the
  closure property the Gaussian-restricted densities `f · γ` need.
* `Arlib.logConcave_const` — constants are log-concave.

/-- **Log-concavity** on `ℝ`, in multiplicative form:
`f(x)^(1−t) · f(y)^t ≤ f((1−t)x + ty)` for every `t ∈ [0,1]`.

Nonnegativity is carried separately (`hf : ∀ x, 0 ≤ f x`) rather than bundled, so the
definition composes with Mathlib's `Real.rpow` lemmas without side conditions. -/

  ∀ x y t : ℝ, 0 ≤ t → t ≤ 1 →
    f x ^ (1 - t) * f y ^ t ≤ f ((1 - t) * x + t * y)

/-- **Log-concave functions are unimodal**: on any interval, the value is at least the
smaller of the two endpoint values.

This is the pointwise fact underneath the one-dimensional isoperimetric inequality — it is
what stops a log-concave density from dipping in the middle of the separating interval,
and hence what makes the middle set carry mass. -/

/-- **A product of log-concave functions is log-concave.**

This is the closure property the analysis of Gaussian-restricted densities needs: if `f`
is log-concave and `γ` is the Gaussian weight (log-concave, being `exp` of a concave
quadratic), then `f · γ` is log-concave. -/
