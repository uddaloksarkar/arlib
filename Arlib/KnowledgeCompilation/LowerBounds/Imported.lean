# The imported hardness results, as explicit hypotheses

The paper's headline theorems rest on results proved elsewhere.  This file makes
each of them a **named bundle of data and properties**, so that a downstream
theorem takes it as a parameter and a reader of the statement can see exactly
what it is conditional on.

This is the area's §1.3 commitment (`ROADMAP.md`), and it is not pedantry.  The
fixed-partition hardness below is the *sole* source of quantitative content in
the entire paper: every other step is a reduction that moves a bound around.
Were it an `axiom`, `thm: main` would typecheck while proving nothing at all, and
the formalization would be worthless in a way that no amount of `#print axioms`
checking would reveal.  As a hypothesis it is honest — and, just as importantly,
anyone who later proves it can discharge the hypothesis and the whole chain
becomes unconditional with no other change.

## Why there are no asymptotics here

The paper states these results with `Õ` and `Ω̃`.  The bundles below instead carry
**explicit numeric bounds as parameters** — `termBound`, `coverBound` — and the
downstream theorems will relate the bounds they are given to the bounds they
produce.  The result is a chain of fully explicit implications with no
asymptotic notation anywhere: *given* hardness with these constants, the
separation has those constants.

This is `ROADMAP.md` §5 applied at the boundary.  It is strictly more useful than
encoding `Ω̃`: it says something for every choice of constants, it is far easier
to prove, and the asymptotic packaging is recovered by instantiating the
parameters at the end.  Encoding "polylogarithmic factors suppressed" as a Lean
predicate would be a substantial development in its own right, consumed exactly
once, at the very last step.

## What is *not* here

De Colnet–Mengel (used only by the arithmetic-circuit section) is deliberately
absent: it needs vocabulary — the relabelling `φ` — that does not exist yet.  It
belongs here once it does.

`SDD` closed under polynomial-time complementation (used only by `thm: sep`,
`source/kc/arXiv.tex:465`) was in the same position and is now here, as
`SDDComplementation`: `Circuits/SDD.lean` supplies `IsSDDAt`, the vocabulary it
was waiting for.

/-- **I1 — fixed-partition hardness** (`thm: fixed_part`,
`source/kc/arXiv.tex:311`), from Göös et al., building on GLMWZ and Balodis et
al.

The data: a function on variables `Z`, presented as an unambiguous `k`-DNF `ψ`
with at most `termBound` terms, together with a *balanced* partition `P` under
which certifying the value `0` needs at least `coverBound` rectangles.

The paper's clause (2) reads `NCC₀^Π(g) = Ω̃(k²)`.  Since `NCC` is by definition
`log₂ Cov` (inventory D20) and we never take logarithms, that clause appears
here directly as a lower bound on `Cov₀^Π` — which is what every consumer
actually uses.

**This is not to be proved here.**  It is a substantial paper in its own right,
and it carries all of the quantitative content of the main theorem. -/

/-- **I1′ — fixed-partition hardness for unions** (`thm: fixed_or`,
`source/kc/arXiv.tex:671`), from Göös et al., Theorem 2.  Same provenance and
same status as `FixedPartitionHard`; used only for `thm: union` and hence for
the disjunction and existential-quantification results.

Two differences from I1.  The hardness is about the *union* `f ∪ g` rather than
about a single function, and it is measured by `UCC₁` — unambiguous protocols —
rather than `NCC₀`.  Since `UCC = log₂ Par` (inventory D20), that appears here as
a lower bound on `Par₁`, the rectangular *partition* number.  Both `f` and `g`
must be presented as unambiguous `k`-DNFs. -/

/-- **I5 — SDD is closed under complementation, in polynomial time** (Darwiche,
via `source/kc/arXiv.tex:465`), used only by `thm: sep`.

The paper's sentence is "we may complement this SDD to get an SDD for `¬f` of
size polynomial in `|C|`".  Three things are made explicit here.

*The polynomial.*  Following `ROADMAP.md` §5, "polynomial" is the pair of
parameters `c, d` and the bound `|C'| ≤ c·|C|^d`.  A downstream theorem then
relates the constants it is given to the constants it produces, with no
asymptotic notation anywhere.

*The v-tree is preserved.*  Complementation of an SDD negates its terminals and
leaves its structure alone, so the output respects the *same* v-tree.  Stated
this way the bundle is both closer to the truth and much easier to consume: the
lower bound needs a v-tree for `C'`, and asking the import to produce one out of
nowhere would be asking for more than it gives.

*Nothing about reachability.*  The bundle used to carry a third clause, that the
output circuit has no unreachable nodes, purely so that a consumer could get from
`IsSDDAt` — which constrains only what lies below the source — to `Respects` and
`Deterministic`, which then quantified over every node index.  That was
`ROADMAP.md` gap G1; with the two conditions now imposed on the reachable nodes,
`NNF.IsSDDAt.respectsFrom` bridges the two outright and the clause is gone. -/

/-! ## A non-vacuity check

Every headline theorem in the area is conditional on one of the bundles above,
and on nothing else.  So there is a failure mode that `#print axioms` cannot
detect and that would make the entire development worthless: if a bundle's
fields were jointly **unsatisfiable**, every theorem taking it as a hypothesis
would be vacuously true, would typecheck, and would report only the three
standard axioms.

This is the same worry that made these imports structures rather than `axiom`s
(module docstring, and `ROADMAP.md` §1.3) — but making them structures does not
by itself answer it.  Inhabiting them does.  What follows exhibits a witness for
each, so that "conditional on `FixedPartitionHard`" is known to be a hypothesis
about something rather than about nothing.

*What these witnesses are not.*  They are the smallest possible instances, on two
variables, with `coverBound = partBound = 1`.  They say nothing whatsoever about
the interesting content — that `2^{Ω̃(k²)}` rectangles are needed — which is a
genuine theorem of Göös et al. and is exactly what is being imported.  The check
is a consistency check on the *shape* of the bundle: no field contradicts
another, the balancedness condition is satisfiable alongside the hardness
condition, and so a reader knows the conditional statements are not empty.  A
bound of `1` is nonetheless not nothing: it is the strongest bound these
degenerate formulas admit, and getting it requires the `sInf` to be over a
nonempty set, which is precisely the junk-value trap that
`Communication/Measures.lean` documents. -/

/-! ### The bundle this section does not discharge

`SDDComplementation` gets no witness here, and the reason is worth recording
rather than leaving as an omission.

Its field is not a bound on a number but a `∀` over *every* SDD, demanding an
actual complement circuit for each.  There is no degenerate instance: one cannot
take `c = d = 0` and return a circuit of size `0`, because `NNF` carries a
`root : Fin size` and so has no size-`0` inhabitants.  Producing a witness would
mean implementing complementation and proving it correct — which is precisely
the imported content, Darwiche's theorem, and not a shape check.

So `thm: sep` remains conditional on a bundle not known here to be inhabited.
That is an honest weaker position than the one `thm: main` and `thm: union`
enjoy, and it is stated rather than hidden. -/
