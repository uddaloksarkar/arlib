# Tseitin-formulas: the parity system of a charged graph

Foundation module for `KnowledgeCompilation.Tseitin`, which follows Florent
de Colnet and Stefan Mengel, *Characterizing Tseitin-formulas with short regular
resolution refutations* (`source/kc/decolnet/main.tex`).  This file formalizes
the paper's "Tseitin-Formulas" paragraph (`source/kc/decolnet/main.tex:339`),
its Proposition 3 (satisfiability, `:343`) and Proposition 4 (model count,
`:347`), and the conditioning operation (`:351`).

## The object

For a graph `G = (V, E)` and a *charge function* `c : V → 𝔽₂`, the Tseitin-formula
`T(G, c)` has one Boolean variable `x_e` per edge `e ∈ E` and one parity
constraint per vertex,
`χ_v : ∑_{e ∋ v} x_e = c(v)  (mod 2)`,
and `T(G, c) := ⋀_{v ∈ V} χ_v`.

## Design decisions

**Semantic, not syntactic.**  As in `BranchingPrograms.Basic` (`φ(G)`) and
`Forgetting.Basic`, no CNF datatype is built.  `Formula G c` is directly the
predicate on assignments "every vertex parity constraint holds".  The paper uses
`T(G, c)` in two guises — a system of parity constraints and, once it turns to
proof systems (`:353`), a CNF encoding — but every statement formalized here
(Propositions 3 and 4, conditioning) is about the *satisfying assignments*, so
the semantic predicate is the right object and the CNF encoding is deferred to
the resolution modules (see `ROADMAP.md`).

**Values in `ZMod 2`, not `Bool`.**  An assignment to the edge variables is a map
`{e // e ∈ G.edgeSet} → ZMod 2`.  The paper writes `x_e ∈ {0, 1}` and the
constraint as a sum mod `2`; taking the values in the field `𝔽₂ = ZMod 2` makes
the parity constraint a genuine linear equation and lets the GF(2) double-counting
of Proposition 3 be `Finset.sum` manipulation rather than `Bool` case analysis.
This is the same choice the source's linear-algebra proofs make implicitly.

**Edge variables indexed by the edge set.**  The variable type is the subtype
`{e // e ∈ G.edgeSet}`, so `|E|` free variables and no phantom ones — which is
what Proposition 4's count `2^{|E| − |V| + K}` is about.

## What is proved here

* **Proposition 3, the easy direction** (`even_charge_of_sat`) is proved in full:
  if `T(G, c)` is satisfiable then every connected component has even total
  charge.  The argument is the GF(2) double count — summing `χ_v` over a
  component, each edge of the component is counted at both endpoints, so the
  edge contributions cancel mod `2`.
* **Proposition 3, the converse** (even charge ⟹ satisfiable) is carried as an
  inhabited bundle `TseitinSatisfiabilityConverse`, per `ROADMAP.md` §1.3: it
  needs a spanning-forest construction that Mathlib v4.15's tree API does not
  support cheaply.  `tseitin_satisfiable_iff` assembles the two directions into
  the paper's biconditional.
* **Proposition 4, the model count**, is carried as an inhabited bundle
  `TseitinModelCount` (a GF(2)-rank fact), not proved here.

Both bundles are inhabited at the foot of the file so that the conditional
statements are known not to be vacuous.

/-- **An assignment** to the edge variables of `G`: a value in `𝔽₂ = ZMod 2` for

index set of the sum in the parity constraint `χ_v`
(`source/kc/decolnet/main.tex:341`, the set `E(v)`). -/

of the edge variables incident to `v` equals the charge `c v`, in `𝔽₂`. -/

  (∑ e ∈ incEdges G v, α e) = c v + 1

/-- **The Tseitin-formula `T(G, c)`** (`source/kc/decolnet/main.tex:341`) as a
predicate on assignments: `α` is a *model* iff it satisfies the parity constraint
of every vertex.  (Named `Formula` rather than `Tseitin` to avoid a namespace

/-! ## Conditioning on an edge literal

Conditioning `T(G, c)` on a literal `ℓ_e` for `e = s(a, b)` yields another
Tseitin-formula `T(G − e, c')` (`source/kc/decolnet/main.tex:351`).  The
underlying graph is `G` with the edge `e` removed; the charge is unchanged for
`¬x_e` and shifted at the two endpoints for `x_e`.  This file provides the graph
and the charge functions — the object `T(G − e, c')` — with the semantic
conditioning correspondence itself deferred to the `Splitting` module, where the
branch recursion consumes it (see `ROADMAP.md`). -/

/-- **`G − e`**, the graph obtained by deleting a single edge `e`
(`source/kc/decolnet/main.tex:351`, `G' = G - e`). -/
def deleteEdge (e : Sym2 V) : SimpleGraph V := G.deleteEdges {e}

charge at each endpoint of `e`. -/

/-- **Proposition 3, the easy direction** (`source/kc/decolnet/main.tex:343`,
`proposition:satisfiability_tseitin_formula`, one direction).  If `T(G, c)` is
satisfiable, then every connected component `U` of `G` has even total charge,
`∑_{v ∈ U} c(v) = 0 (mod 2)`.

The proof sums the constraint `χ_v` over the vertices of the component.  Each
incident edge is counted once at each of its two endpoints — both of which lie in
the component, since an edge joins vertices of the same component — so every edge
variable appears an even number of times and cancels over `𝔽₂`, leaving
`∑_{v ∈ U} c(v) = 0`. -/

/-! ## Proposition 3, the converse — as an inhabited import

The converse — even charge on every component implies satisfiability — needs a
spanning-forest construction (choose a spanning tree of each component, set the
non-tree edges to `0`, and propagate the tree edges from the leaves inward),
which Mathlib v4.15 does not support cheaply.  Following `ROADMAP.md` §1.3 it is
carried as a named bundle, threaded into the biconditional as a hypothesis, and
inhabited below so the conditional is not vacuous. -/

/-- **Proposition 3, the converse** (`source/kc/decolnet/main.tex:343`), as an

/-! ## Proposition 4, the model count — as an inhabited import -/

/-- **Proposition 4** (`source/kc/decolnet/main.tex:347`,
`proposition:number_model_tseitin_formula`, from Glinskih–Itsykson), as an
imported hypothesis: a satisfiable Tseitin-formula `T(G, c)` has exactly
`2^{|E| − |V| + K}` models, where `K` is the number of connected components.

The count is stated multiplicatively — `2^{|E| + K} = #models · 2^{|V|}` — to
avoid truncated natural-number subtraction; this is equivalent to
`#models = 2^{|E| − |V| + K}` because `|V| ≤ |E| + K` for every graph.  It is a
GF(2)-rank fact (the solution space of the parity system is an affine subspace of
dimension `|E| − rank`, and `rank = |V| − K`) and is not proved here.  The count
is written with `Nat.card`, so the statement needs no `Decidable` instance for
`Formula`. -/

/-! ## Non-vacuity of the imported bundles

Each imported bundle above is inhabited by a concrete witness, so that the
statements conditional on it are known to be about something rather than
vacuously true (`ROADMAP.md` §1.3). -/

/-- **`TseitinSatisfiabilityConverse` is inhabited**, for the zero charge on any
graph: the all-zero assignment satisfies `T(G, 0)`, so the converse holds
outright.  A degenerate but genuine witness — it establishes only that the shape
of the hypothesis is satisfiable, not the general converse, which is the imported
content. -/

vertex type, `|E| = 0`, `|V| = 0`, `K = 0`, and there is a unique (empty)
assignment, which satisfies `T`; the count `2^{0+0} = 1 · 2^0` holds.  A
degenerate but genuine witness (the antecedent `∃ α, Formula` is *true* here, so
the count clause is not vacuously discharged). -/
