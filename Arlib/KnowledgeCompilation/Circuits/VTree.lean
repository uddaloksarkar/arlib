# V-trees and structuredness

The one ingredient that turns d-DNNF into structured d-DNNF.  A *v-tree* over a
set of variables `X` is a full, rooted, binary tree whose leaves are in 1-1
correspondence with `X` (paper `def: vtree`, `source/kc/arXiv.tex:150`), and a
DNNF *respects* a v-tree when every `∧`-node of the circuit splits its variables
along some node of the tree (`source/kc/arXiv.tex:154`).  Structured (d-)DNNF is
then (d-)DNNF that respects *some* v-tree (`def: structure`,
`source/kc/arXiv.tex:156`).

## Trees here, DAGs there

`ROADMAP.md` §1.1 forbids the inductive-tree encoding for *circuits*, and that
prohibition is not weakened by anything in this file: a v-tree genuinely is a
tree, so the inductive encoding is the honest one for it.  The size of a v-tree
is never measured — only its shape and the variable sets hanging below its nodes
matter — so the exponential-unfolding argument that rules out inductive circuits
simply does not apply.  `VTree` is inductive; `NNF` remains a DAG; the two are
related only through `Finset V`-valued variable sets, never structurally.

Taking the inductive `leaf`/`node` also makes "full" automatic: there is no way
to build a node with one child.

## Well-formedness: disjointness, not injectivity

The paper's "1-1 correspondence with `X`" rules out a tree with a repeated leaf
label, so the bare inductive type is slightly too generous and needs a side
condition.  Two formulations are available.  The literal one says the list of
leaf labels has no duplicates; the useful one says that at every internal node
the two children have disjoint variable sets.  We take the second as the
definition (`VTree.WellFormed`) because it is exactly the shape in which the
condition is consumed downstream — `Respects` hands you a v-tree node and you
immediately want the two sides to be disjoint — and prove the equivalence with
the literal reading in `VTree.wellFormed_iff_nodup_leaves`, so that nobody has
to take on faith that the definition says what the paper says.

Note that well-formedness is a statement about the tree alone; the ambient
variable set `X` of the paper is recovered as `T.vars`, and a v-tree "over `X`"
is a well-formed `T` with `T.vars = X`.  Since no result here quantifies over
`X`, carrying it as a separate field would be pure friction.

## Nodes of a v-tree

`Respects` quantifies over the nodes of `T`, so we need a notion of node.  A
`Finset (VTree V)` of nodes is not available: `VTree V` has no `DecidableEq`
for general `V`.  Instead `VTree.IsSubtree s T` is an inductive relation with the
usual reflexive/left/right constructors, and "`s` is a node of `T`" is
`IsSubtree s T`.  Identifying a node with the subtree hanging below it is
harmless here because every property we ever ask of a node — its variable set,
its two children — is a property of that subtree.

## Respecting: `∀ g, ∃ t`, and not the other way round

The definition at `source/kc/arXiv.tex:154` gives, *for each* `∧`-node `g` of
`C`, *some* node `t` of `T` with `var(gₗ) ⊆ var(t_ℓ)` and `var(gᵣ) ⊆ var(t_ᵣ)`.
The v-tree node may — and in every interesting circuit does — depend on `g`; the
common misreading, a single `t` serving all of `C`, would collapse the class to
something far smaller than d-SDNNF.  `Respects` below is stated in the correct
order.

Since only the *children* of `t` are ever used, we quantify over the pair of
children directly: `∃ tl tr, IsSubtree (.node tl tr) T ∧ …`.  This says the same
thing — a node of `T` with two children is exactly a subtree of the form
`.node tl tr` — while removing the projections `t_ℓ`, `t_ᵣ`, which on the
inductive type would otherwise have to be partial functions or carry a
non-leafness hypothesis.  Leaves of `T` are correctly excluded: the paper's `t_ℓ`
and `t_ᵣ` only exist at internal nodes.

The `∧`-nodes quantified over are the *nodes of the circuit*, i.e. those
reachable from its source, matching `Decomposable` and `Deterministic` in
`Circuits/NNF.lean`; see that file's module docstring for why the conditions are
relativized this way.  `RespectsFrom T r` is the version at an arbitrary source
and `Respects T` is it at `C.root`.

## Structuredness implies decomposability

`Respects.decomposable` is the reason well-formedness is worth its keep: if the
two children of a v-tree node have disjoint variable sets, then so do the two
children of any `∧`-node that respects it.  Decomposability is therefore *free*
for a respecting circuit, and `IsSDNNF` states it anyway only because the paper
does (structuredness is defined as a property *of* a DNNF), so that the
definition is a transcription rather than a reformulation.  `isSDNNF_of_respects`
records that the redundancy is real.

/-! ## Laminarity

The variable sets of the nodes of a well-formed v-tree form a *laminar family*:
any two of them are nested or disjoint, never properly crossing.  Geometrically
this is the statement that two subtrees of a tree are either one inside the
other or hang off disjoint branches, and well-formedness is what turns "disjoint
branches" into "disjoint variable sets".

This is the fact that makes the rectangle lemma work at all
(`LowerBounds/RectangleLemma.lean`): the cut variable set `X = var(s)` comes from
a node `s` of the v-tree, so it cannot straddle the two children of any other
node — and therefore at most one child of any `∧`-node of a respecting circuit
can carry `X`-variables. -/

/-- **The variable sets of a well-formed v-tree form a laminar family.**

For any two nodes `a`, `b` of a well-formed `T`, either one variable set
contains the other or the two are disjoint.  Proved by induction on `T`: if `a`
and `b` descend into the same child, this is the inductive hypothesis; if they
descend into different children, well-formedness of the node they part at gives
disjointness; and if either is the root, containment is `IsSubtree.vars_subset`.

Well-formedness is genuinely needed — without it the two children of a node may
share variables, and then two nodes hanging off different branches can cross. -/

/-- **A node's variable set never straddles the children of another node.**

Let `s` be any node of a well-formed v-tree `T`, and let `node tl tr` be any
node of `T`.  Then either both children of that node sit inside `var(s)`, or one
of them avoids `var(s)` entirely.

The excluded configuration is "both children meet `var(s)` but neither is
contained in it", and it is excluded because `var(s)` is itself a node's
variable set: by laminarity `var(t_ℓ)` and `var(t_r)` are each nested in or
disjoint from `var(s)`, and the mixed nestings force a sibling — or `s` itself —
to have no variables, which `vars_nonempty` forbids.

This is exactly the form consumed by `NNF.Respects.conjSplit`, and through it
the whole rectangle lemma: *at most one child of an `∧`-node carries
`X`-variables, unless both are entirely inside `X`.* -/

`t_ℓ` and `t_ᵣ` do not exist.
