# Measurability of a quantity read at a random index

A recurring obligation in any formalization of a randomized process: a quantity
is read at an index that is *itself* a random variable — `f (X ω) ω`, where `X`
picks which of a family of functions to evaluate.  Nothing in Mathlib applies
directly, because `f` is a function of two arguments and only the second is the
sample point.

When the index type is **countable** the obligation dissolves: the preimage
splits as the countable union `⋃ c, {X = c} ∩ (f c)⁻¹ B` over the level sets of
the index.  This module is that split, in the three forms one actually needs.

## Main statements

* `measurable_at_index` — `ω ↦ F (g ω) ω` is measurable, given that each level
  set of `g` is measurable and each `F c` is.
* `measurableSet_at_index` — the level-set form, for a codomain carrying no
  measurable space at all.
* `measurable_comp_index` — `ω ↦ f (g ω)` for a measurable countably-valued `g`
  and an **arbitrary** `f`: no measurability hypothesis on `f` is needed, since a
  countable space with measurable singletons carries the discrete σ-algebra.
* `measurableSet_const_eq` — the degenerate case.

read the sample point at all. -/

/-- **Evaluation at a measurably-varying index is measurable.**  If the index
`g` takes countably many values, each on a measurable event, and each *fixed*
index gives a measurable function `F c`, then `ω ↦ F (g ω) ω` is measurable:
its preimage is the countable union of the pieces. -/

statement means no σ-algebra on `β` ever has to be chosen — useful when `β` is a
finite state space that one would rather not equip. -/

/-- **An arbitrary function of a countably-valued measurable index is
measurable.**  A countable space with measurable singletons carries the discrete
σ-algebra, so *no* measurability hypothesis on `f` is needed: the preimage
splits along the (countably many) level sets of `g`.

This is what lets a schedule indexed by a random *counter* go through with the
schedule an entirely arbitrary function: `fun ω => rate (N ω)` is measurable
purely because `ℕ` is countable, so no regularity is required of `rate`. -/
