# Expectation and conditional expectation over a finite probability space

We give a concrete expectation `Ex P X = ∑_ω mass(ω) · X(ω)` and prove its basic
algebra (linearity, `Ex 1 = 1`, monotonicity).

Conditional expectation `E[X | F]` is characterized by two facts:

* **Fixed-variable rule**: if `X` is fixed by `F` then
  `E[XY | F] = X · E[Y | F]`; in particular `E[X | F] = X`.
* **Tower rule**: if `F₁ ⊆ F₂` then
  `E[E[X | F₂] | F₁] = E[X | F₁]`, hence `E[E[X | F₂]] = E[X]`.

We package a conditional-expectation operator together with these two facts as
an interface `HasCondExp`.  The concrete construction over `FinProb` (via the
partition induced by `F`) satisfies this interface; we record the interface here
so that downstream results can be developed against the two facts alone.

This interface is not merely axiomatized: `Probability/CondExpConstruction.lean`
*constructs* a `HasCondExp P` for every `FinProb P` (`FinProb.mkCondExp`) — the
partition/fiber conditional expectation `E[X | π] = (∑_{cell} mass·X)/(∑_{cell}
mass)` — and proves `fixed_rule`, `tower` and `cond_Ex` from first principles.
So the two facts above are theorems about a concrete object.
