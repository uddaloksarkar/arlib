# From a high-moment bound to an exponential tail

`Arlib.Probability.MomentMethod` supplies the *generalized Chebyshev* step

  `Pr[|X - μ| ≥ a] ≤ Ex[(X - μ)^{2t}] / a^{2t}`,

which converts control of a single high even moment into a **polynomial** tail.
The Schmidt–Siegel–Srinivasan `k`-wise Chernoff bound is obtained from that step
by *optimizing over `t`*: if the `2t`-th central moment obeys a bound of Stirling
shape, then a suitable choice of `t` turns the polynomial bound into an
**exponential** one.  This file isolates that optimization.  It is pure real
analysis: nothing here knows that `X` is a sum, or that anything is `k`-wise
independent.  The combinatorial input — the moment bound itself — is taken as a
hypothesis, so that the two halves of the argument can be developed and checked
independently.

## The optimization, in one line

Suppose the `2t`-th central moment satisfies, for every `t` in an allowed range,

  `Ex[(X - μ)^{2t}] ≤ K · (2 t μ / e)^t`.                                  (H)

Markov at `a` then gives

  `Pr[|X - μ| ≥ a] ≤ K · (2 t μ / (e a²))^t`,

and as soon as `2 t μ ≤ a²` the base of that power is at most `e⁻¹`, so the whole
bound collapses to `K · e^{-t}`.  Everything after that is bookkeeping: `t` has to
be a natural number, so one rounds, and the constant `K` has to be absorbed, so
one spends `log K` of the exponent on it.

Concretely, with a "deviation budget" `s` satisfying `s μ ≤ a²`, choosing

  `t = ⌈s/3 + d⌉₊`,   where `K ≤ e^d`,

works as soon as `s ≥ 6 (1 + d)`: the ceiling gives `t ≥ s/3 + d`, hence
`K e^{-t} ≤ e^{d - t} ≤ e^{-s/3}`, while `t ≤ s/3 + d + 1 ≤ s/2` gives
`2 t μ ≤ s μ ≤ a²`, which is what licenses the collapse.  The result is

  `Pr[|X - μ| ≥ a] ≤ e^{-s/3}`.

## The two branches of the `k`-wise Chernoff bound

Both branches of the Schmidt–Siegel–Srinivasan statement are this one theorem
with different budgets `s`, at the same deviation `a = γ μ`:

* `γ` arbitrary, `s = γ² μ`: then `s μ = (γ μ)²` exactly, and the conclusion is
  `Pr[|X - μ| ≥ γ μ] ≤ e^{-γ² μ / 3}`  (`exp_tail_relative_of_moment_bound`);
* `γ ≥ 1`, `s = γ μ`: then `s μ = γ μ² ≤ γ² μ² = (γ μ)²`, and the conclusion is
  `Pr[|X - μ| ≥ γ μ] ≤ e^{-γ μ / 3}`  (`exp_tail_relative_of_moment_bound_ge_one`).

The second is the weaker conclusion, but it asks the moment hypothesis (H) to
hold only for `2 t ≤ γ μ` rather than for `2 t ≤ γ² μ`, which is exactly the
trade-off in the literature: for `γ ≥ 1` the Stirling-shape moment bound is only
available up to a smaller order.  The side condition `2 t ≤ s` handed to (H) is
precisely the "`k`-wise independence suffices" condition `k ≥ γ² μ` (resp.
`k ≥ γ μ`) of the paper statement, read as `2 t ≤ k`.

## Structure

* `tail_le_moment_div` — generalized Chebyshev about an **arbitrary** centre `μ`
  (the version in `MomentMethod` centres at `Ex X`);
* `tail_le_of_moment_le` — the same with the moment bound supplied as a
  hypothesis: `Ex[(X-μ)^{2t}] ≤ M` gives `Pr[|X-μ| ≥ a] ≤ M / a^{2t}`;
* `pow_div_le_exp_neg` — the analytic core: `0 ≤ b`, `0 < c`, `b e ≤ c`, `r ≤ t`
  imply `(b/c)^t ≤ e^{-r}`;
* `exists_moment_index` — the rounding lemma: for `s ≥ 6 (1 + d)` and `d ≥ 0`
  there is a positive natural `t` with `s/3 + d ≤ t` and `2 t ≤ s`;
* `exp_tail_of_moment_le_pow` — "for THIS `t`", shape-agnostic: a moment bound
  `K · B^t` with `e B ≤ a²` gives `Pr[|X-μ| ≥ a] ≤ K e^{-t}`;
* `exp_tail_of_moment_bound_at` — the same at the Stirling base `B = 2 t μ / e`;
* `exp_tail_of_moment_bound` — the assembled optimization;
* the two `γ`-branch corollaries above, plus a `K = 1` specialization.

No `sorry`.

/-! ## The Markov step about an arbitrary centre

`even_moment_tail` in `Arlib.Probability.MomentMethod` is stated about the true
mean `Ex X`.  Downstream one usually has a *named* `μ` — the mean of an idealized
model, or a quantity the mean is only known to approximate — so we repeat the
argument about an arbitrary centre.  Nothing in the proof uses that `μ` is the
mean; the deviation event is simply contained in the event that the (nonnegative,
even) power `(X - μ)^{2t}` exceeds `a^{2t}`. -/

/-- **Generalized Chebyshev about an arbitrary centre.** For any real `μ`, any
`t : ℕ` and any `a > 0`,
`Pr[|X - μ| ≥ a] ≤ Ex[(X - μ)^{2t}] / a^{2t}`.
Taking `μ = Ex X` recovers `even_moment_tail`; taking additionally `t = 1`
recovers Chebyshev. -/

/-! ## The analytic core

Two elementary facts do all the optimization work: a ratio bounded by `e⁻¹` has
`t`-th power at most `e^{-t}`, and an integer `t` with prescribed lower and upper
real bounds exists as soon as the window is wide enough. -/

/-- **The `e⁻¹` collapse.** If `0 ≤ b`, `0 < c` and `b · e ≤ c`, then `b / c ≤ e⁻¹`
and hence `(b/c)^t ≤ e^{-t} ≤ e^{-r}` for every real `r ≤ t`.

This is the lemma that converts a polynomial Markov bound into an exponential
one: applied with `b = 2 t μ` and `c = e a²`, its hypothesis `b e ≤ c` is just
`2 t μ ≤ a²`. -/

/-- **The rounding lemma.** The optimization wants `t ≈ s/3 + d`, but `t` must be
a natural number.  As soon as the budget `s` exceeds `6 (1 + d)` the window
`[s/3 + d, s/2]` has length at least `1`, so it contains an integer; `⌈s/3 + d⌉₊`
is one, and it is positive. -/

/-! ## The optimization

`exp_tail_of_moment_bound_at` is the "for THIS `t`" statement — every hypothesis
about `t` is explicit, and no rounding happens.  `exp_tail_of_moment_bound` feeds
it the `t` produced by `exists_moment_index`. -/

/-- **The tail bound at a fixed `t`, shape-agnostic form.** Suppose the `2t`-th
central moment is bounded by `K · B^t` for *some* base `B` small enough that
`e · B ≤ a²`.  Then Markov at `a` collapses to

  `Pr[|X - μ| ≥ a] ≤ K · e^{-t}`.

This is the entire optimization step, with neither the choice of `t` nor the
shape of the moment bound fixed: any moment estimate of the form
`Ex[(X - μ)^{2t}] ≤ K · B^t` — Stirling shape or not — feeds into it, the only
requirement being that `B` beats `a²/e`. -/

/-- **The tail bound at a fixed `t`, Stirling shape.** Given the moment bound
`Ex[(X - μ)^{2t}] ≤ K · (2 t μ / e)^t` *at this particular `t`*, together with the
compatibility condition `2 t μ ≤ a²`, Markov collapses to

  `Pr[|X - μ| ≥ a] ≤ K · e^{-t}`.

No rounding and no choice of `t` occurs here: this is the exact content of the
optimization step, with the choice of `t` deferred to the caller.  It is
`exp_tail_of_moment_le_pow` at `B = 2 t μ / e`, for which `e B ≤ a²` is literally
`2 t μ ≤ a²`. -/

/-- **The optimization, assembled.** Let `μ > 0`, let `a > 0` be the deviation,
and let `s` be a *deviation budget* compatible with `a` in the sense `s μ ≤ a²`.
Assume the Stirling-shape moment bound

  `Ex[(X - μ)^{2t}] ≤ K · (2 t μ / e)^t`   for every `t ≥ 1` with `2 t ≤ s`,

with `K ≤ e^d` for some `d ≥ 0`.  Then, provided the budget is at least
`6 (1 + d)`,

  `Pr[|X - μ| ≥ a] ≤ e^{-s/3}`.

The proof picks `t = ⌈s/3 + d⌉₊`.  The lower bound `t ≥ s/3 + d` pays for the
constant `K` (`K e^{-t} ≤ e^{d-t} ≤ e^{-s/3}`); the upper bound `t ≤ s/2`, which
is what `s ≥ 6 (1 + d)` buys, gives `2 t μ ≤ s μ ≤ a²` and so licenses the
`e⁻¹`-collapse of `exp_tail_of_moment_bound_at`.

The condition `2 t ≤ s` guarding the moment hypothesis is deliberate: it is the
only fact about `t` that the caller of the moment bound may assume, and it is
exactly the `k`-wise independence budget of the Schmidt–Siegel–Srinivasan
statement (`2 t ≤ k` with `k ≥ s`). -/

This is the `γ ≤ 1` branch of the Schmidt–Siegel–Srinivasan bound (the hypothesis
`γ ≤ 1` is not needed for the implication itself — it is needed only to make the
moment hypothesis available in that range). -/
