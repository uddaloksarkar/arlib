# From the coin marginal to the reduce step

`ProductSpace.condCE_forget` computes the conditional expectation that forgets one
coin.  Here we specialize it to the shape used by a "reduce" (random sub-sampling)
step.

Consider a set `Ŝ` of elements, each kept with probability `p` by a *fresh
keep-coin*: an element `w ∈ Ŝ` survives into the reduced set `S` iff its keep-coin
fires with probability `p`.  So the indicator factors as

  `𝟙_{w∈S} = 𝟙_{w∈Ŝ} · keep`      (`ind = indHat · keep`),

where `keep` is a function of that fresh coin alone.  Conditioning on `𝓕̂`
(everything except the keep-coin) fixes `indHat` and the threshold `p`, and
averages `keep` to its firing probability.  `condCE_reduceStep` is exactly this,
obtained from `condCE_forget`:

  `E[𝟙_{w∈Ŝ}·keep | forget j] = 𝟙_{w∈Ŝ} · (firing probability)`.

`condCE_reduceStep_pair` handles two elements passing through the same reduce with
independent keep-coins, and `condCE_reduceStep_forgetSet`/`condCE_reduceStep_data`
give the same identity against a filtration that forgets many coins (including a
data-dependent threshold).  Everything here is proved with no `sorry`.

/-- **The reduce step, concretely.**  Suppose

* `indHat` and `threshold` do not depend on coin `j` (they are `𝓕̂_i`-measurable),
* the keep-coin `keep` averages, over coin `j`, to `threshold`
  (its firing probability).

Then conditioning on everything except coin `j` sends the reduce indicator
`indHat · keep` to `indHat · threshold`, i.e. `E[indHat · keep | forget j]
= indHat · threshold`. -/

If coin `j` is uniform over a grid (`coinVal` its `[0,1]`-values) and its CDF at

value is `<` the threshold" averages to `threshold` — discharging `hKeepAvg`. -/

elements pass through the same reduce with *independent* keep-coins `j₁ ≠ j₂`.
If the reduce indicator factors as `A · val₁(coin j₁) · val₂(coin j₂)` with `A`
measurable (independent of both keep-coins), then conditioning on everything
except the two keep-coins factors into the two firing probabilities:
`E[X | forgetSet {j₁,j₂}](ω) = A ω · (∑_{c₁} coinMass j₁ c₁ · val₁ c₁)

/-- **The reduce step against a many-coin filtration.**  A realistic filtration
forgets *all* the keep-coins of a layer, not just the one under consideration.
This version conditions on `forgetSet T` (any `T` containing the keep-coin `j`):
if `indHat` is `forgetSet T`-measurable and `keep` depends only on coin `j ∈ T`,
the extra forgotten coins wash out and we still get `indHat · (firing prob)`. -/

/-- **The reduce step with a data-dependent threshold.**
The firing probability may itself be random (depending on earlier coins), so the
keep-decision depends on *both* its coin `j` and the threshold.
Given only that (i) `indHat` and `threshold` are `forgetSet T`-measurable and
(ii) the single-coin average of `keep` equals `threshold`, conditioning on
`forgetSet T` still yields `indHat · threshold`. -/
