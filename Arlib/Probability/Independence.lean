# Independence and the Chernoff-type bound for independent runs

A tail bound on the number of events that occur among an independent family of
"bad" events follows from independence together with the intersection tail bound.

We already have the Chernoff-type **intersection tail bound**
(`intersection_tail_bound_paper`): if `Pr[⋂_{i∈S} Eᵢ] ≤ p^{|S|}` for all `S`,
then `Pr[∑ᵢ 𝟙_{Eᵢ} ≥ B/2] ≤ (4p)^{B/2}`.  Its hypothesis is *exactly* what
independence provides: for an independent family with `Pr[Eᵢ] ≤ p`,

  `Pr[⋂_{i∈S} Eᵢ] = ∏_{i∈S} Pr[Eᵢ] ≤ ∏_{i∈S} p = p^{|S|}`.

So `chernoff_of_indep` discharges the tail bound for any independent family of
events with `Pr[Eᵢ] ≤ p`.  Proved with no `sorry`.

**Probability model.**  Developed against the abstract `ProbSpace` interface:
events are *predicates* `P.Ω → Prop`.  The Chernoff bridge inherits the
`[IsAdm …]` guards of `intersection_tail_bound_paper` (auto-discharged over
`FinProb`, supplied from bounded-measurability in the continuous-coin model).

/-- **Chernoff-type bound for an independent family.**
If `E₁,…,E_B` are independent with each `Pr[Eᵢ] ≤ p ≤ 1/2`, then the probability
that at least `B/2` of them occur is at most `(4p)^{B/2}`.

The admissibility binders are inherited from
`intersection_tail_bound_paper` — auto-discharged over `FinProb`. -/
