# A countably-indexed family of independent uniform variables

Mathlib v4.15 has **no** infinite product measure: `MeasureTheory.Measure.pi`
requires `[Fintype ι]`, and there is no Kolmogorov extension theorem and no
Ionescu–Tulcea construction — only `MeasureTheory.IsProjectiveLimit`, which
gives *uniqueness* and no existence.  So the object every formalization of a
countably-long randomized process needs — countably many independent draws,
each rich enough to realise an arbitrary law on a finite set — has to be built
by hand.

This module supplies it by a route that **does not need a product construction
at all**: normalised **Haar measure on the infinite-dimensional torus**

    Ω = ι → 𝕋,      𝕋 = AddCircle (1 : ℝ),      ι countable.

`Ω` is a compact (Tychonoff), second-countable, metrizable topological group, so
`MeasureTheory.Measure.addHaarMeasure` applies directly, and the resulting
measure is a probability measure because the whole space is the reference
compact set.  Independence and uniformity of the coordinates are then *derived*,
not built in: the pushforward of `μ` along the projection onto any finite block
of coordinates is a left-invariant regular probability measure on a finite
torus, hence — by uniqueness of Haar measure — equal to the finite product of
circle Lebesgue measures.  Independence follows by evaluating on cylinders.

## Main statements

* `mu` — the probability space `Ω = ι → 𝕋`, for any countable `ι`.
* `map_proj` — the projection onto a finite block pushes `μ` to `Measure.pi`.
* `map_coord` — every coordinate is uniform on the circle.
* `iIndepFun_coord` — **the coordinates are a mutually independent family**
  indexed by the countable set `ι`.
* `comap_proj_eq_cylinderEvents`, `indep_cylinderEvents` — disjoint coordinate
  blocks generate independent σ-algebras, in the `MeasureTheory.cylinderEvents`
  form filtrations are built from.
* `filtration`, `indep_filtration_step` — for `ι = ℕ × S × A` with `S`, `A`
  finite, the filtration `ℱ t = σ(draws strictly before time t)`, and the
  independence of the time-`t` draws from it.
* `toIoc`, `map_toIoc` — a circle coordinate, read through `AddCircle.equivIoc`,
  is a uniform real on `(0,1]`.

`Arlib.Probability.InverseCDF` turns that uniform into a draw from an arbitrary
probability vector on a finite type.

The one genuinely non-formal step, and it is short: the pushforward of `μ` onto
a finite block is a left-invariant regular probability measure on a finite
torus, so Mathlib's `isAddLeftInvariant_eq_smul_of_regular` identifies it with
the product of circle Haar measures up to a scalar, which normalisation pins at
`1`. -/

/-! ## The time filtration of a block-indexed family

Specialise to `ι = ℕ × S × A` with `S`, `A` finite: the natural index set for
"the draw made at time `t` at the label `(s,a)`", one independent draw per
label per step.  Because `S` and `A` are finite, the set of indices with time
`< t` is *finite*, which is what makes `iIndepFun.indepFun_finset` — a
finite-block statement — enough.

The two-component label `S × A` costs nothing and saves a caller with a single
label type from having to pair up: take `A := Unit`. -/
