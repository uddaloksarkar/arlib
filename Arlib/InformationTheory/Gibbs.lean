# Gibbs' inequality

This file proves the single analytic fact that the rest of `Arlib.InformationTheory`
runs on: the sum `∑ a, p a * log (p a / q a)` is nonnegative whenever `p` and `q`
are nonnegative, `q` has total mass at most that of `p`, and `q` is absolutely
continuous over `p` (`q a = 0 → p a = 0`).

## Main results

* `Arlib.InformationTheory.sum_mul_log_div_nonneg` — Gibbs' inequality in the
  general (sub-normalised `q`) form.
* `Arlib.InformationTheory.KLdist_nonneg` — nonnegativity of the Kullback–Leibler
  divergence between two probability distributions.

## Implementation notes

The proof is the standard `log x ≤ x - 1` argument, applied termwise. Writing
`log (p a / q a) = - log (q a / p a)` and bounding `log (q a / p a) ≤ q a / p a - 1`
gives the termwise inequality `p a - q a ≤ p a * log (p a / q a)`; summing and
using `∑ q ≤ ∑ p` finishes. Mathlib's conventions `Real.log 0 = 0` and `x / 0 = 0`
make the degenerate terms behave, so no junk-value side conditions leak into the
statement.
