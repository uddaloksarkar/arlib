# Shannon entropy, mutual information and KL divergence: definitions

Mathlib has no discrete Shannon information theory (only `Real.negMulLog`, the
binary entropy function, and a measure-theoretic `klDiv`), so this area builds it.
This file holds *only the definitions* plus the identities that are true by
unfolding; the substantive inequalities live in sibling files, each of which
depends on this one and not on the others.

## Main definitions

* `Hdist p` — Shannon entropy `∑ a, -p a * log (p a)` of a distribution.
* `H P X` — entropy of a random variable, `Hdist (dist P X)`.
* `H₂ P X Y` — joint entropy `H P (pair X Y)`.
* `condH P X Y` — conditional entropy `H₂ P X Y - H P Y`.
* `I P X Y` — mutual information `H P X - condH P X Y`.
* `condI P X Y Z` — conditional mutual information `I(X;Y|Z)`.
* `KLdist p q` — Kullback–Leibler divergence `∑ a, p a * log (p a / q a)`.

## Conventions

All logarithms are natural (`Real.log`), so entropies are in nats and the
`log (card α)` bounds are natural logs. Mathlib's convention `log 0 = 0` and
`x / 0 = 0` means `Hdist` and `KLdist` are total, with `0 * log 0 = 0` and
`0 * log (0 / q) = 0` giving the standard values on the boundary — this is
exactly the convention Shannon theory wants, so we do not fight it.

`condH`, `I` and `condI` are defined by *subtraction* rather than as sums. That
makes the chain rules (`I_pair_chain` in `ChainRule.lean`) pure algebra — they
hold by `ring` with no side conditions — and confines all the analytic work to a
single nonnegativity fact, `condI_nonneg`, proved in `Jensen.lean`.

/-! ### Identities that hold by unfolding

These are the algebraic backbone. Each is `rfl` or `ring` after unfolding, and
they are stated here so that the sibling files can use them without re-deriving
the bookkeeping. -/
