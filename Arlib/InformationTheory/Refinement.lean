# Bounds on a conditional law descend from any refinement of the conditioning

An adaptive lower-bound argument computes the law of the next observation given
*everything the process has done so far* — every coin, every internal draw — because that is
the only level at which the law has a closed form. What the information-theoretic bound then
consumes is the law of the next observation given only the *public transcript*, which is a
coarsening: many coin histories produce the same transcript.

Passing from the fine conditioning to the coarse one is usually described as an obstruction,
on the grounds that the fine conditional laws differ from cell to cell and so "do not
collapse to a single law". They do not have to. The coarse conditional law is a **convex
mixture** of the fine ones, with weights the conditional masses of the cells, and every
bound of the two shapes an argument of this kind actually uses — a pointwise upper bound
`p(z) ≤ c`, and an upper bound `∑_{z ∈ B} p(z) ≤ δ` on the mass of a set of outcomes — is
preserved by convex mixtures. So a bound proved uniformly over the fine cells descends to
the coarse conditioning for free.

That is the content of this file. It is elementary; it is recorded because the mistake it
prevents is not.

## Setup

`W : P.Ω → ι` is the fine conditioning variable (the full history), `g : ι → α` a statistic
of it, and `fun ω => g (W ω)` the coarse conditioning variable (the public transcript). `Z`
is the observation.

## Main results

* `dist_comp_eq_sum_fiber`, `dist_pair_comp_eq_sum_fiber` — the coarse law is the sum of the
  fine laws over the fibre `g⁻¹(a)`.
* `dist_pair_comp_eq_sum_mul_condDist` — **the mixture identity**: the coarse joint law is
  `∑_{u ∈ g⁻¹(a)} P(W = u) · P(Z = b | W = u)`.
* `condDist_comp_le` — **the payoff**: a pointwise bound `P(Z = b | W = u) ≤ c` holding for
  every reachable `u` in the fibre gives `P(Z = b | g(W) = a) ≤ c`.
* `condDist_comp_sum_le` — the same for the mass of a set `B` of outcomes, which is the form
  a "the exceptional letters carry mass at most `δ`" step needs.
* `condDist_comp_le_of_exceptional` — the version with an exceptional set of *cells*: if the
  bound is only known on the cells outside `Bad`, the conclusion picks up
  `P(W ∈ Bad, g(W) = a) / P(g(W) = a)`. This is what one gets when the fine bound holds only
  on a good event of the process's own randomness.

## Scope

Nothing here says the fine conditional laws resemble each other, and nothing here transfers
a *lower* bound: a mixture can only be pushed up by its largest component, so a lower bound
on every cell does descend (by the same argument with the inequality reversed) but a
two-sided estimate does not become a two-sided estimate on the mixture with the same
constants unless both directions are assumed. Only the upper-bound direction is proved here,
because it is the one that is used.

/-- **A pointwise upper bound on the conditional law descends to any coarsening.**

If, for every reachable value `u` of the fine conditioning variable compatible with the
coarse value `a`, the conditional probability of the outcome `b` is at most `c`, then the
same holds after coarsening. No relation between the fine cells is needed: the coarse law is
their convex mixture.

The hypothesis `0 ≤ c` is used only on the null cell `P(g(W) = a) = 0`, where `condDist` is
`0` by convention. -/

/-! ### The form the variational bound consumes

`Arlib.InformationTheory.condI_le_log_add_of_ratio_le_on` and its `_of_mass_le` companion
take their hypotheses conditioned on `pair X W` — the source variable together with the
*public* history. These two corollaries discharge exactly those hypotheses from the
corresponding statements about a refinement `V` of the pair, which is where an adaptive
process actually has a closed form for its next-step law. -/
