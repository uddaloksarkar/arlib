# The conditional variational bound with an exceptional set

`CondVariational.lean` ends with `condI_le_log_of_ratio_le`: if the conditional
law of one answer is dominated by `r` times a reference kernel,

    `P_{Z | X = a, W = w}(b) ≤ r * Q w b`   for **every** letter `b`,

then `I(X ; Z | W) ≤ log r`. That shape is too rigid for the query lower bounds
it was written for. A typical argument splits the alphabet into regimes: on some
letters the likelihood ratio really is bounded by `r`, but on a residual set of
letters the ratio is *unbounded* — there is simply no `r` that works — and what
one controls instead is the total contribution of those letters to the KL sum,
which is a directly estimated, very small additive quantity.

This file relaxes the hypothesis exactly that far. Fix a "good" set `G` of
letters. Require the ratio bound only on `G`, and require, in place of a ratio
bound off `G`, an explicit bound `ε` on the residual KL mass

    `∑_{b ∉ G} p b * log (p b / q b) ≤ ε`.

The conclusion degrades by exactly the same additive `ε`:

    `KL(p ‖ q) ≤ log r + ε`   and   `I(X ; Z | W) ≤ log r + ε`.

In the conditional statement the good set is allowed to depend on the level `a`
*and* the prefix `w`, which it must: which regime a letter falls in is a function
of both.

## Main results

* `Arlib.InformationTheory.KLdist_le_log_add_of_ratio_le_on` — the KL lemma: a
  ratio bound on `G` plus an additive bound on the residual KL mass gives
  `KL(p ‖ q) ≤ log r + ε`.
* `Arlib.InformationTheory.condI_le_log_add_of_ratio_le_on` — the conditional
  corollary, obtained from `condI_le_of_KL_le` exactly as
  `condI_le_log_of_ratio_le` is.
* `Arlib.InformationTheory.condI_le_log_of_ratio_le'` — the sanity check: taking
  `G = univ` and `ε = 0` recovers `condI_le_log_of_ratio_le` verbatim, so nothing
  was lost in the relaxation.
* `Arlib.InformationTheory.KLdist_le_log_add_of_ratio_le_on_of_mass_le` and
  `Arlib.InformationTheory.condI_le_log_add_of_ratio_le_on_of_mass_le` — a
  convenience form in which the residual hypothesis is replaced by the two facts
  that are usually what one actually has: the *reference* law is bounded below by
  `m > 0` on the exceptional letters, and the *true* law puts total mass at most
  `δ` on them. The additive error is then `δ * log (1 / m)`.

## Relation to `condI_le_log_of_ratio_le`

`condI_le_log_add_of_ratio_le_on` is strictly stronger: `condI_le_log_of_ratio_le'`
below derives the old statement from the new one by instantiating `G := univ` and
`ε := 0`, and the private lemma
`condI_le_log_of_ratio_le_eq_condI_le_log_of_ratio_le'` certifies that the
derived statement is *the same statement* — the two have identical types, so no
hypothesis was silently added, dropped or reordered in the generalisation.
Nothing in `CondVariational.lean` is modified; this file only adds.

## Implementation notes

The only real content is the KL lemma, and it is a two-line split once the
degenerate letters are understood.

* On `G`, the termwise bound `p b * log (p b / q b) ≤ p b * log r` is
  `mul_log_div_le_mul_log_of_le`. It needs **no** absolute-continuity hypothesis:
  if `p b = 0` both sides are `0` by `Real.log 0 = 0` and `x / 0 = 0`, and if
  `p b > 0` then `q b > 0` is *forced* by `p b ≤ r * q b` together with
  `0 ≤ q b`, so `Real.log_le_log` applies with no side condition. This is why the
  statement carries no hypothesis of the form `∀ b, p b ≠ 0 → q b ≠ 0`: on the
  good letters absolute continuity is a consequence, and on the bad letters the
  hypothesis `hbad` is about the KL mass directly, so a `q b = 0` letter with
  `p b ≠ 0` is not excluded — it simply makes `hbad` unsatisfiable unless `p b`
  is `0` too, since `p b * log (p b / 0) = p b * log 0 = 0`. (Mathlib's junk
  values are load-bearing in the *permissive* direction here.)
* Summing the good part gives `(∑_{b ∈ G} p b) * log r ≤ log r`, using
  `0 ≤ log r` from `1 ≤ r` and `∑_{b ∈ G} p b ≤ ∑_b p b = 1`.
* The two pieces are recombined with `Finset.sum_sdiff` over `G ⊆ univ`.

Only nonnegativity of `q` is used, never `∑ q = 1`; the `IsProbDist q` form is
kept in the headline statements because that is what the conditional corollary
supplies. The primed variants take the weaker hypothesis.

/-- **The termwise ratio bound.** If `p ≤ r * q` at a point, with `q` nonnegative
and `r` positive, then `p * log (p / q) ≤ p * log r` there.

No absolute-continuity hypothesis is needed. If `p = 0` both sides vanish
(`Real.log 0 = 0`, `x / 0 = 0`); if `p > 0` then `q > 0` is forced by the
hypothesis, and the bound is monotonicity of `Real.log`. -/

/-- **The termwise bound on an exceptional letter.** If the reference law is
bounded below by `m > 0` and the true law is bounded above by `1`, then
`p * log (p / q) ≤ p * log (1 / m)`.

This is the estimate that replaces a ratio bound where none exists: it costs
`log (1 / m)` per unit of exceptional mass, which is useful precisely when that
mass is tiny. -/

/-- **The good part of a KL sum.** If `p b ≤ r * q b` on a set `G`, with `r ≥ 1`,
then the part of the KL sum indexed by `G` is at most `log r`.

The two ingredients are the termwise bound and `∑_{b ∈ G} p b ≤ ∑_b p b = 1`;
`0 ≤ log r` is what lets the second be used as a bound on a coefficient. -/

/-! ### The KL lemma -/

/-- **The KL divergence under a ratio bound on a subset, with an additive error.**
If `p b ≤ r * q b` for every `b` in a set `G` (with `r ≥ 1`), and the remaining
letters contribute at most `ε` to the KL sum, then `KL(p ‖ q) ≤ log r + ε`.

This is the version of `KLdist_le_log_of_pointwise` that a three-regime argument
can actually supply: it does not ask for a likelihood-ratio bound off `G`, where
typically none exists, only for a bound on that region's contribution.

Only nonnegativity of `q` is used, hence the hypothesis `hq : ∀ b, 0 ≤ q b`. No
absolute-continuity hypothesis appears: see the module docstring. -/

/-- **The KL divergence under a ratio bound on a subset, with an additive error**,
stated with `q` a probability distribution. This is the form the conditional
corollary consumes; the substance is `KLdist_le_log_add_of_ratio_le_on'`, which
needs only `0 ≤ q`. -/

/-! ### The conditional bound -/

/-- **The conditional variational bound with an exceptional set.** If, for every
level `a` and prefix `w`, the conditional law of the answer is dominated by
`r * Q w b` on a set `G a w` of letters, and the letters outside `G a w`
contribute at most `ε` to that cell's KL sum, then

    `I(X ; Z | W) ≤ log r + ε`.

This is `condI_le_log_of_ratio_le` with the pointwise hypothesis weakened to a
pointwise hypothesis *on a subset* plus an additive account of the rest. The good
set may depend on both `a` and `w`, as it must: the regime a letter falls in
depends on the hidden level and on the prefix of answers already seen.

The absolute-continuity side condition `hQ0` is unchanged — it is the hypothesis
of `condI_le_of_KL_le`, about the *prefix-conditional* law, and has nothing to do
with the exceptional set. -/

/-! ### Sanity check: the old bound is a special case -/

/-- **`condI_le_log_of_ratio_le`, re-derived from the exceptional-set bound.**
Taking `G a w = univ` and `ε = 0` makes the exceptional sum empty, so the new
statement collapses to the old one verbatim.

This is a check that the relaxation did not weaken anything: `condI_le_log_of_ratio_le`
is exactly the `G = univ`, `ε = 0` corner of
`condI_le_log_add_of_ratio_le_on`. -/

/-- **The two statements are literally the same statement.** `condI_le_log_of_ratio_le'`
above is not merely *an* analogue of `CondVariational.lean`'s
`condI_le_log_of_ratio_le`; the two have identical types, so the `G = univ`,
`ε = 0` specialisation of `condI_le_log_add_of_ratio_le_on` reproduces the old
endpoint with no hypothesis added, removed or reordered.

The `funext` succeeds only if every one of the eighteen binders — implicit type
variables, `Fintype`/`DecidableEq` instances, the space, the four maps, the two
side conditions, `r`, and the ratio hypothesis — matches on the nose; the
remaining goal is an equality of two proofs of one Prop, closed by proof
irrelevance. -/

/-! ### A convenience form of the exceptional hypothesis

The hypothesis `hbad` is a bound on a KL-like sum, which is not the shape an
application usually has in hand. What one usually has is: the reference law is
not too small on the exceptional letters, and the true law puts very little mass
there. Those two facts give `hbad` with `ε = δ * log (1 / m)` — the shape of the
paper-style estimate "exceptional contribution ≤ (tiny mass) × (a log factor)".

The requirement `m ≤ 1` is not restrictive: `m` is a lower bound on the masses of
a probability distribution, so `m ≤ 1` unless the exceptional set is empty. It is
needed to know `log (1 / m) ≥ 0`, which is what lets the mass bound `δ` be
substituted for the actual exceptional mass. -/

/-- **The exceptional KL mass, bounded by mass times a log factor.** If the
reference law is at least `m > 0` on `S` and `p` is a probability distribution,
then `∑_{b ∈ S} p b * log (p b / q b) ≤ (∑_{b ∈ S} p b) * log (1 / m)`. -/
