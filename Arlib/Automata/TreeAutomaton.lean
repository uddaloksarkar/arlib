# Tree automata over unranked ordered trees

A **nondeterministic top-down tree automaton** `A : TreeAutomaton S Γ` reads a
finite `Γ`-labelled tree from the root downwards: it starts at the root in some
state satisfying `A.init`, and a transition `A.step q a qs` lets a node in state
`q` carry the label `a` and hand the states `qs` to its children, in order.

## Design decisions

**Unranked, ordered.**  `LTree.node : Γ → List (LTree Γ) → LTree Γ` puts no
bound on the arity and fixes an order on the children.  This is the model in
which a transition relation is a subset of `S × Γ × S*` — the shape used by
Arenas–Croquevielle–Jayaram–Riveros, whose `Δ ⊆ S × Σ × (⋃ᵢ₌₀ᵏ Sⁱ)` is the
present relation with an extra arity cap — and it is what a *tree
decomposition* produces, where a node's children form a list and different
children play different roles.  A ranked automaton is the special case in which
`A.step q a qs` forces `qs.length` from `a`.

**Acceptance is an inductive predicate, not a recursive function.**  The
recursive occurrence sits inside `List.Forall₂`, in a strictly positive
position, so no termination argument is needed.  The children condition then
carries `qs.length = ts.length` for free (`List.Forall₂.length_eq`), which
would otherwise be a side hypothesis on every constructor application.

**A set of initial states, not one.**  `A.init : S → Prop`.  Collapsing to a
single initial state costs one fresh state and a copy of the root transitions;
carrying the set avoids that bookkeeping everywhere, and it is the form in
which a reduction naturally produces an automaton.

**No decidability, no finiteness.**  `init` and `step` are `Prop`-valued and
the state type is unconstrained.  A reduction may therefore build an automaton
with no proof obligations at all, and finiteness enters only where a *count* is
taken.

## Main definitions

* `LTree Γ` — finite `Γ`-labelled ordered trees; `LTree.size` counts nodes.
* `LTree.induction_on` — the usable eliminator.  `LTree` is a *nested*
  inductive, so the generated `LTree.rec` carries two motives and the
  `induction` tactic refuses it; this repackages it in the expected shape.
* `TreeAutomaton S Γ` — `init` and `step`.
* `TreeAutomaton.Accepts A q t` — `t` is accepted from state `q`.
* `TreeAutomaton.lang A` — the accepted language `L(A)`.
* `TreeAutomaton.langOfSize A n` — the `n`-slice `L_n(A)`, which is what the
  counting problem `#TA` asks about.

no children. -/

/-! #### Eliminator

`LTree` is a nested inductive (the recursive occurrence sits under `List`), so
Lean generates a two-motive recursor that the `induction`/`cases` tactics will
not accept.  This wrapper gives the shape every proof below wants: to prove a
statement at a node, one may assume it at each child. -/

at every child. -/

/-! #### Size

`size` is written as a `mutual` block with a list-level companion: the
recursive occurrence is nested under `List`, so Lean infers neither structural
nor well-founded recursion for the `(ts.map size).sum` form. -/

counting problem `#TA` is parameterised. -/

/-! #### Relabelling by subtree

`attachMap f t` relabels every node of `t` by applying `f` to *the subtree
rooted at that node*, not merely to its label.  This is the shape a reduction
needs when the label it wants to write at a node depends on which node it is —
for instance the label `[p, z̄ ↦ b̄]` of a hypertree-decomposition node.  Node
identity is then carried by the subtree itself, so no separate notion of
"position in the tree" is required. -/
