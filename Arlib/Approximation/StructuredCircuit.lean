# V-trees and structured arithmetic circuits

A **v-tree** is a binary tree over variables that fixes a scope decomposition: a
leaf is a single variable, and an internal node splits its scope as the disjoint
union of its children's.  A **structured circuit** over a v-tree `V` is an
arithmetic circuit whose product gates decompose scopes exactly as `V`
prescribes — a leaf sits at a v-tree leaf, and a product-then-sum node sits at a
v-tree node with children circuits over the v-tree's children.

The point of indexing `Circuit` by a `Vtree` is that **two circuits share a
v-tree precisely when they are indexed by the same `V`**.  That is the honest
hypothesis under which the two circuits' features can be compared region by
region and reduced by a single coreset per region (the domain-reduction scheme of
`Arlib.Approximation.Coresets.RegionTree`): a function that consumes two circuits
over a *shared* `V` — recursing on both at once — simply does not typecheck for
circuits over different v-trees, because the constructor of one is forced by the
shared index of the other.  The circuits are otherwise free: they may carry
different gate counts and different coefficient tensors at every region, i.e.
different computational structure over the same v-tree.

`Vtree.Assign` is the joint assignment space determined by `V` alone (the product
of the leaf domains); every circuit over `V` — and every comparison of two of
them — has this same assignment space.

No `sorry`.

/-! ## Structured circuits -/

/-- A **structured arithmetic circuit** over the v-tree `V`, with `g` gates at the
root region.  Its scope-decomposition tree *is* `V`: the constructor is forced by
`V`'s.  A `leaf θ` sits at a v-tree leaf and stores the `g` gates' values on the
variable's domain; a `node l r c` sits at a v-tree node and computes gate `j` as
`∑_{p,q} c j p q · l_p · r_q` (a product-then-sum layer).  The gate counts and the
coefficient tensor `c` are free — only the tree shape is pinned by `V`. -/
