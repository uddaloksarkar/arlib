# Weighted point sets and the ℓ¹ evaluation functional

A *coreset* in the ℓ¹-subspace-embedding sense is a weighted set of points with
feature vectors, used as a stand-in for a much larger such set: it is required to
reproduce, to within a relative error, the weighted sum of *absolute linear
tests* `∑ᵢ μᵢ |⟨y, vᵢ⟩|` for **every** query `y` simultaneously.  That functional
is the ℓ¹ norm of `A y` for the matrix `A` with rows `μᵢ vᵢᵀ`, which is why
Lewis-weight row sampling is the tool that produces such sets.

This file defines the objects and the functional; `Embedding` defines the
approximation relation, and `Tensor` the constructions that build big weighted
point sets out of small ones.

* `WPS ι d` — a weighted point set indexed by `ι` with features in `ℝ^d`:
  nonnegative weights `wt` and a feature map `feat`.  The index type is a
  *parameter*, so that constructions may change it — the Cartesian product of two
  weighted point sets is indexed by the product `ι₁ × ι₂`, transparently.
* `dot y v` — `∑ a, y a * v a`, the linear test.
* `WPS.E C y` — `∑ i, C.wt i * |dot y (C.feat i)|`, the evaluation functional.
* `WPS.exact` — the *unreduced* weighted point set on a finite domain `X`, all
  weights `1`; `E_exact` says its functional is `∑ x, |⟨y, Φ x⟩|`, the quantity a
  domain reduction is required to preserve.

Points carry no identity beyond their index: two indices may well carry the same
feature vector, and a construction that merged them would be wrong (their weights
must add).  Indexing rather than using a `Finset` of features is what makes this
automatic.

No `sorry`.

/-- A **weighted point set** indexed by `ι`, with feature vectors in `ℝ^d`: a
nonnegative weight and a feature vector for each index.

The points themselves — the domain assignments a coreset is a subset of — are
deliberately absent: nothing in the ℓ¹-embedding theory looks at them, only at
their features and weights.  The index type is a parameter rather than a field so
that `WPS.tensor` can name the product index type transparently. -/
