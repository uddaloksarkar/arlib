# Two-sided multiplicative error windows

Approximation algorithms whose guarantee is *relative* accumulate their error
multiplicatively: each stage replaces a quantity `b` by something in
`[lo · b, hi · b]`, and the analysis must compose such windows, sum them over a
family, iterate them along a chain, and finally calibrate the per-stage
tolerance so that the composed window is the one the theorem promises.

`Arlib.relErr` (in `Arlib.Prelude`) already names the symmetric window
`(1 ± ε)·b`.  What is missing — and what every relative-accuracy argument needs —
is the *asymmetric* window `[lo·b, hi·b]`, because that is the shape a window
takes after composition: `(1-δ)^n` and `(1+δ)^n` are not of the form `1 ∓ ε` for
a common `ε`.

* `Between lo hi a b` — `a` lies in the window `[lo·b, hi·b]`.
* `Between.trans` — windows compose by multiplying their endpoints.
* `Between.sum` — a window shared by every member of a family is inherited by
  the sums.  This lemma itself needs no sign hypothesis, because the two
  inequalities are summed term by term; but note that *obtaining* the per-term
  windows for scaled quantities does need nonnegative coefficients
  (`Between.const_mul`), and a negative coefficient genuinely breaks the
  conclusion.
* `Between.pow_of_chain` — a per-step window `[lo, hi]` along `F 0, …, F n`
  telescopes to `[lo^n, hi^n]`.
* `one_add_div_pow_le` / `one_sub_div_pow_ge` — the calibration
  `δ = ε/(3n)`: `(1 + ε/(3n))^n ≤ 1 + ε` and `1 - ε ≤ (1 - ε/(3n))^n` for
  `ε ∈ [0,1]`, hence `Between.relErr_of_calibrated`, which turns a telescoped
  window straight into `a ∈ relErr ε b`.

The `(1+·)^n` bound is proved by the elementary induction
`(1+a)^n ≤ 1 + 2na` valid whenever `n·a ≤ 1/2` (`one_add_pow_le_one_add_two_mul`);
no exponential and no logarithm appears.

## The `(1 ± ε)` calculus

`Between.trans` composes two windows around a *chain* `a → b → c`.  Chains of
`(1 ± ε)` manipulations also need the windows of two *independent* pairs to be
combined, which is what the second half of this file supplies:

* `Between.mul` / `relErr_mul` — `(1±ε)(1±ε') ⊆ (1 ± (ε + ε' + εε'))`;
* `Between.pow` / `relErr_pow` — the honest form of the informal identity
  `(1±ε)^n = (1±nε)`.  It is **not** an identity: `(1+ε)^n > 1 + nε` whenever
  `ε > 0` and `n ≥ 2` (`one_add_pow_lt_one_add_mul_example`).  The correct
  statement needs a hypothesis `n·ε ≤ 1/2` and a factor two on the upper side;
* `Between.prod` / `relErr_prod` — the `Finset.prod` companion of `Between.sum`;
* `Between.div` / `relErr_div` — a **ratio** of two `(1±ε)` quantities is
  `(1 ± 2ε/(1-ε))`, not `(1±ε)`.  The failure of the naive form is recorded as
  `relErr_div_counterexample`;
* `compose_tol_le` and `tol_absorb` — the bookkeeping that turns a composed
  tolerance `ε + ε' + εε'` back into a named target tolerance.

Nothing here mentions any particular data structure: this is the arithmetic every
relative-error guarantee in the area runs on, which is why it sits at area level
rather than under `Coresets/`.  No `sorry`.

/-! ## The window -/

/-- `Between lo hi a b` says that `a` lies in the multiplicative window
`[lo · b, hi · b]` around `b`.  Unlike `Arlib.relErr` the window is allowed to
be asymmetric, which is what composition forces: composing `(1 ± δ)` with itself
`n` times gives `[(1-δ)^n, (1+δ)^n]`. -/

/-- **Windows compose.**  If `a` is within `[lo', hi']` of `b` and `b` is within
`[lo, hi]` of `c`, then `a` is within `[lo'·lo, hi'·hi]` of `c`.

The nonnegativity of the *outer* endpoints is needed and is exactly what makes
the two inequalities chain: a negative multiplier would reverse them. -/

/-- **A shared window is inherited by sums.**  The two inequalities are summed
term by term, so this needs no sign hypothesis.

Do not read more into that than it says: a *weighted* sum `∑ cᵢ · aᵢ` inherits the
window only when the `cᵢ` are nonnegative, since that is what `Between.const_mul`
needs to produce the per-term windows in the first place.  With coefficients
`(1, -1)` the conclusion is false. -/

composes to the window `[lo^n, hi^n]` between the endpoints. -/

      have := trans hlo hhi hstep hprev
      simpa [pow_succ, mul_comm] using this

/-- **Two independent windows multiply.**  If `a` sits in `[lo·b, hi·b]` and `a'`
sits in `[lo'·b', hi'·b']`, then `a·a'` sits in `[lo·lo'·(b·b'), hi·hi'·(b·b')]`.

This is *not* `Between.trans`: `trans` composes two windows along a chain
`a → b → c` of three values, whereas this combines windows around two unrelated
pairs.  It is the step behind `(1±ε)(1±ε') ⊆ (1 ± (ε + ε' + εε'))`.

The four nonnegativity hypotheses are what make the two inequalities multiply in
the right direction; `0 ≤ a`, `0 ≤ a'` and `0 ≤ hi·b` are *derived*, so they are
not asked for. -/

      _ = hi * hi' * (b * b') := by ring

/-- **Powers.**  A window `[lo·b, hi·b]` raises to the window `[lo^n·b^n, hi^n·b^n]`
around `b^n`.

Unlike `Between.pow_of_chain`, which telescopes a *per-step* window along a chain,
this raises a single window to a power; it is the `(1±ε)^n` step. -/

      _ = hi ^ n * b ^ n := mul_pow _ _ n

/-- **A shared window is inherited by products.**  The `Finset.prod` companion of
`Between.sum`.

Contrast with `Between.sum`, which needs no hypotheses at all: here the per-factor
windows have to be multiplied together, so the lower endpoint and every base must
be nonnegative — exactly the hypotheses of `Between.mul`. -/

/-- **Quotients.**  Dividing a window by a window *crosses* the endpoints: the
smallest possible quotient is the smallest numerator over the largest denominator.

This is the shape that makes the paper's `fpras2.tex:283` step wrong — see
`relErr_div` and `relErr_div_counterexample`.  The denominator window must be
bounded away from `0` (`0 < lo'`, `0 < b'`), which is what guarantees `a' > 0`. -/

/-! ## Reciprocal windows

The two facts a median-of-means / reciprocal-estimator argument runs on: passing a
relative-error window through `x ↦ 1/x`, and the observation that a "loose" `(1±ε/2)`
window sits inside the "failing" reciprocal interval `[b/(1+ε), b/(1-ε)]`.  Both are
pure algebra over `ℝ`, independent of any probability model. -/

`1/median ∈ (1±ε)/N` and the median lying in the reciprocal window `(1±ε)⁻¹·N`. -/

The four window operations above, restated in the symmetric `relErr` form that
the papers are written in, together with the two places where the symmetric form
that a paper *would* write is simply false. -/

/-- `a ∈ (1 ± ε)·b` says exactly `|a - b| ≤ ε·b`.

The equivalence is unconditional: no sign hypothesis on `b` or on `ε` is needed,
because both sides unfold to the same pair of linear inequalities. -/

The composed tolerance really is `ε + ε' + εε'` and not `ε + ε'`: the upper bound
`(1+ε)(1+ε') = 1 + ε + ε' + εε'` is attained. -/

/-- **Chaining.**  If `a` is a `(1±ε)`-estimate of `b` and `b` is a

This is the `relErr` face of `Between.trans`, and is the workhorse of every

/-! ### Powers

The informal step `(1 ± ε)^n = (1 ± nε)` is **not** an identity, and neither of
its two halves is free.  The lower half is Bernoulli's inequality and is true as
stated; the upper half is false, and needs both a hypothesis relating `n` and `ε`
and a factor two.  See `one_add_pow_lt_one_add_mul_example`. -/

/-- **The upper half of `(1 ± ε)^n = (1 ± nε)` is false.**  A witness at `n = 2`,
`ε = 1/10`: `1 + 2·(1/10) = 1.2` but `(1 + 1/10)^2 = 1.21`.

Recorded because a chain of `(1±ε)` manipulations that uses `(1+ε)^n ≤ 1 + nε`
is unsound; the correct bound is `one_add_pow_le_one_add_two_mul`, which costs a
factor two and the hypothesis `n·ε ≤ 1/2`. -/
theorem one_add_pow_lt_one_add_mul_example :
    (1 : ℝ) + 2 * (1 / 10) < (1 + 1 / 10) ^ 2 := by norm_num

/-- **The lower half**, which *is* true with the naive constant: `1 - nε ≤ (1-ε)^n`,
hence a fortiori `1 - 2nε ≤ (1-ε)^n`.

Stated with the factor two so that it pairs with `one_add_pow_le_one_add_two_mul`
into a single symmetric window.  The hypothesis `n·ε ≤ 1/2` is used only to
supply `ε ≤ 2` for Bernoulli when `n ≥ 1`. -/

/-- **The honest `(1 ± ε)^n` calibration.**  A window `[(1-ε)^n, (1+ε)^n]` sits
inside the symmetric window `(1 ± 2nε)` as soon as `0 ≤ ε` and `n·ε ≤ 1/2`.

The hypothesis `n·ε ≤ 1/2` is the one the informal identity omits: without it the
upper endpoint `(1+ε)^n` grows without any linear bound. -/

/-- **Powers of a `(1±ε)` estimate.**  If `a = (1±ε)b` then `a^n = (1 ± 2nε)b^n`,
under the hypothesis `n·ε ≤ 1/2`.

This is the sound replacement for the informal `(1±ε)^i = (1±iε)`.  Two things
differ from the informal version and both matter: the constant is `2n`, not `n`
(`one_add_pow_lt_one_add_mul_example`), and `n·ε ≤ 1/2` is a genuine hypothesis,
not a consequence of `ε` merely being "small" — it constrains `ε` *relative to*
`n`.  A bound of the form `ε < c` with `c` independent of `n` does not suffice. -/

a shared tolerance `ε` over `s.card` factors composes to `2·|s|·ε`, provided
`|s|·ε ≤ 1/2`.

Contrast `relErr_sum`, which is free: summation preserves the tolerance, whereas
multiplication multiplies it by the number of factors. -/

/-! ### Quotients

A ratio of two `(1±ε)` quantities is **not** `(1±ε)`.  Both endpoints move: the
largest ratio is `(1+ε)/(1-ε)` and the smallest is `(1-ε)/(1+ε)`, so the smallest
symmetric window containing the ratio has half-width `2ε/(1-ε)`, which blows up as
`ε → 1`. -/

/-- **Quotients.**  If `a = (1±ε)b` and `a' = (1±ε')b'` with `b' > 0` and `ε' < 1`,
then `a/a' = (1 ± (ε+ε')/(1-ε'))·(b/b')`.

The denominator's tolerance enters *divided by* `1-ε'`, which is why `ε' < 1` is
required and why the composed tolerance is not simply `ε + ε'`. -/

is `(1 ± 2ε/(1-ε))`.

This is the corrected form of `fpras2.tex:283` (`ALGORITHM-SPEC.md` §6.2), where
the ratio `p̃ⱼ = Ñ(sⁱ,tⱼ)/Ñ(sⁱ,tⱼ₋₁)` of two `(1±ε₁)` estimates is asserted to be
`(1±ε₁)`.  It is not; the true tolerance is `2ε₁/(1-ε₁) = 2ε₁ + O(ε₁²)`, a factor
two larger.  `relErr_div_counterexample` shows the naive form genuinely fails. -/

/-! ### Absorbing a composed tolerance into a named one

The last step of every chain: the composed tolerance `ε + ε' + εε'` has to be
shown to be at most the tolerance the theorem promises.  `Between.mono` does the
transport; these two lemmas do the arithmetic. -/

/-- **Discharging a composed tolerance.**  To prove `ε + ε' + εε' ≤ c` it suffices
to prove the *linear* bound `ε + 2ε' ≤ c`, provided `ε ≤ 1` and `0 ≤ ε'`.

This is what makes a chain mechanical: the quadratic cross term never has to be
handled by hand, only `ε·ε' ≤ ε'`. -/

/-- **A worked instance of slack absorption.**  For `r ≥ 4` and `ε ∈ [0,1]`,
composing the tolerances `ε/(200r³)` and `ε/(200r⁴)` stays inside `ε/(100r³)`:

`ε/(200r³) + ε/(200r⁴) + ε/(200r³)·ε/(200r⁴) ≤ ε/(100r³)`.

This is the shape of the "absorb a small additive slack" steps in
`partition-size2.tex`; `r ≥ 4` (`partition-size2.tex:483`) is exactly what makes
the `r⁴` term fit in the room left by doubling `200r³` to `100r³`. -/
