# Entropy decay along the chain, and the hypothesis it actually needs

`Chains/ProductEntropy.lean` gives the development its first modified log-Sobolev
inequality, and `Techniques/Entropy.lean` records that nothing converts one into
entropy *decay* along the chain, so there is still no entropy-based mixing-time
bound.  The obvious bridge is the one-step decay

  `Ent_μ(f) − Ent_μ(P f) ≥ ℰ_P(f, log f)`,   (**)

which with `ModLogSobolev μ P ρ` would give `Ent_μ(P f) ≤ (1 − ρ) Ent_μ(f)` and
hence geometric decay.  **The first half of this module shows that (**) is false
for every chain that moves anything at all**, and that the failure is not
repairable by strengthening the hypotheses on `P`.

The reason is that `Techniques/Entropy.lean` already proves the *opposite*
inequality.  `localEnt_le_entropyProduction` says `μ[Ent_P(f)] ≤ ℰ_P(f, log f)`
for every reversible chain, and `localEnt_eq_Ent_sub_Ent` says the left-hand side
*is* the entropy drop `Ent_μ(f) − Ent_μ(P f)`.  So (**) can hold only with
equality, and `act_eq_self_of_entropyProduction_le` shows equality forces
`P f = f`.  `localEnt_le_entropyProduction` is therefore not "half" of the
one-step decay; it is the obstruction to it.

The failure is not an artefact of a lossy comparison: `swapChain`, the
deterministic swap on two states, is reversible, satisfies `ModLogSobolev` with
constant `1`, and has `Ent_μ(P^t f) = Ent_μ(f)` for every `t` and every `f`
(`exists_modLogSobolev_not_entropyContraction`).  It is the entropy analogue of a
bipartite chain having a spectral gap and never converging.  `Techniques/Lazy.lean`
repairs *that* by supplying positive semidefiniteness; here there is nothing of
the kind to supply, because the obstruction is the direction of
`localEnt ≤ entropyProduction`, which holds for the lazy chain as well.  (This
does not say the lazy chain fails to decay — the lazy swap chain collapses in one
step.  It says the route through (**) is closed for lazy chains too.)

What does iterate is the hypothesis with `localEnt` in place of
`entropyProduction`, which is what the monograph's arguments actually establish:

  `EntropyContraction μ P ρ`  :=  `∀ f > 0, ρ · Ent_μ(f) ≤ μ[Ent_P(f)]`.

It is strictly stronger than `ModLogSobolev μ P ρ`
(`EntropyContraction.modLogSobolev`), it is `1`-homogeneous on both sides, and it
gives the whole chain of consequences.  The second half of the module runs that
chain to a mixing-time bound in relative entropy, and the last section shows
where the hypothesis comes from.

## Main declarations

* **`entropyProduction_sub_localEnt`** — the exact defect
  `ℰ_P(f, log f) − μ[Ent_P(f)] = μ[(P f)(log (P f) − log f)]`, the identity
  underlying `localEnt_le_entropyProduction`.
* `eq_of_Ex_mul_log_sub_log_nonpos` — the equality case of the log-sum
  inequality.
* **`act_eq_self_of_entropyProduction_le`** and
  `Ent_sub_Ent_act_lt_entropyProduction` — the refutation of (**).
* `Ex_comp_equiv`, `Ent_comp_equiv` — expectation and entropy are invariant
  under a measure-preserving relabelling of the state space.
* `swapDist`, `swapChain`, `modLogSobolev_swapChain`,
  **`exists_modLogSobolev_not_entropyContraction`** — the counterexample.
* **`EntropyContraction`**, with `EntropyContraction.mono`,
  `entropyContraction_zero`, `EntropyContraction.le_one` and
  **`EntropyContraction.modLogSobolev`**.
* `continuous_Ent_add_const`, **`Ent_act_le_extend`** — a one-step entropy bound
  assumed for `f > 0` holds for `f ≥ 0`, by continuity of `t log t` at `0`.  This
  is the only limit taken anywhere in `Arlib.MarkovChains`, and it is what lets
  the decay be applied at the density of a point mass.
* **`EntropyContraction.Ent_iter_le`** — `Ent_μ(P^t f) ≤ (1 − ρ)^t Ent_μ(f)`.
  No positive-semidefiniteness hypothesis: the contraction is one-sided to begin
  with, so there is no squaring and no need for a two-sided bound.
* `EntropyContraction.klDiv_push_le`, `EntropyContraction.klDiv_iter_push_le`,
  `klDiv_dirac`, `EntropyContraction.klDiv_iter_row_le` — the same statements
  for the relative entropy of the law of the chain.
* **`EntropyContraction.klDiv_iter_row_le_of_log_le`** — the mixing-time bound:
  `D_KL(P^t(x, ·) ‖ μ) ≤ ε` once `t ≥ ρ⁻¹ ln(ln(1/μ_min)/ε)`.
* `localEnt_avg_ge` and **`entropyContraction_avg_of_tensorization`** — where the
  hypothesis comes from: approximate tensorization of entropy for a family `Kᵢ`
  gives entropy contraction at rate `1/(C|ι|)` for the average `avg K`.  This is
  the conclusion that `GlauberTensorization`'s
  `modLogSobolev_glauber_of_approxTensorizationEnt` should have drawn from the
  same hypothesis.

## What is gained over the χ² route, and what is not

`Techniques/EntropyVariational.lean` reaches a bound in relative entropy through
`klDiv ≤ chiSq`, and is honest that this inherits the χ² loss: it needs
`t ≳ γ⁻¹ ln(1/(ε μ_min))`, i.e. `Θ(γ⁻¹ log(1/μ_min))` steps.  The bound here needs
`t ≥ ρ⁻¹ ln(ln(1/μ_min)/ε)`, i.e. `Θ(ρ⁻¹ log log(1/μ_min))`.  The whole of the
difference is `klDiv_dirac`: the initial divergence of a point mass is
`log(1/μ(x))` where `chiSq_dirac` gives `1/μ(x) − 1`.

Two things are *not* claimed.  `ρ` and the Poincaré constant `γ` are different
quantities and nothing here compares them — the improvement is in the dependence
on `μ_min` at a fixed rate.  And the conclusion is in relative entropy, not total
variation: converting it needs Pinsker's inequality, which this development does
not have.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`; no eigenvalue,
and no spectral notion beyond the Dirichlet form, appears anywhere.

/-! ## The gap between the entropy drop and the entropy production -/

/-- **The exact defect in `localEnt_le_entropyProduction`.**  For a reversible
chain and any `f`,

  `ℰ_P(f, log f) − μ[Ent_P(f)] = μ[(P f) · (log (P f) − log f)]`,

the right-hand side being the relative entropy of the pair `(P f, f)`, which
`Techniques/Entropy.lean` bounds below by `0` with the log-sum inequality.

Recording the defect as an *identity* rather than an inequality is what makes the
equality case accessible, and the equality case is what settles whether the
one-step entropy decay `Ent_μ(f) − Ent_μ(P f) ≥ ℰ_P(f, log f)` can hold.  The
proof is the first two steps of `localEnt_le_entropyProduction` and needs no
positivity of `f`. -/

/-- **The one-step entropy decay `Ent_μ(f) − Ent_μ(P f) ≥ ℰ_P(f, log f)` forces
`P f = f`.**

`Techniques/Entropy.lean` proves the inequality in the *opposite* direction —
`localEnt_le_entropyProduction`, i.e. `Ent_μ(f) − Ent_μ(P f) ≤ ℰ_P(f, log f)` for
every reversible chain — so the conjectured decay can only hold with equality,
and by the equality case of the log-sum inequality equality forces `P f = f`.

So the inequality is not merely unproved: outside the trivial case it is *false*,
and no hypothesis short of `P f = f` rescues it.  See
`Ent_sub_Ent_act_lt_entropyProduction` for the contrapositive and
`swapChain` below for a chain where the failure is fatal to the whole
argument. -/

/-! ## Entropy contraction: the discrete-time hypothesis that does the work -/

/-- **Entropy contraction** with rate `ρ`: for every strictly positive `f`,

  `ρ · Ent_μ(f) ≤ μ[Ent_P(f)]`,

the right-hand side being the mean conditional entropy, which by
`localEnt_eq_Ent_sub_Ent` *is* the one-step entropy drop `Ent_μ(f) − Ent_μ(P f)`.

This is the discrete-time analogue of `SpectralGapAtLeast` that actually
iterates.  It is formally the same shape as `ModLogSobolev` with `localEnt` in
place of `entropyProduction`, and both sides are `1`-homogeneous
(`Ent_smul`, `localEnt_smul`), so the condition is not vacuous.  By
`localEnt_le_entropyProduction` it is *stronger* than `ModLogSobolev` with the
same constant (`EntropyContraction.modLogSobolev`), and strictly stronger:
`swapChain` below satisfies the latter with `ρ = 1` and the former with no
positive `ρ` at all. -/

/-! ## The counterexample: a modified log-Sobolev inequality with no decay at all

`act_eq_self_of_entropyProduction_le` says the one-step decay
`Ent_μ(f) − Ent_μ(P f) ≥ ℰ_P(f, log f)` fails for every chain that moves
anything, so `ModLogSobolev` cannot be converted into entropy decay *by that
route*.  This section shows it cannot be converted by any route: the
deterministic swap on two states satisfies `ModLogSobolev` with constant `1` and
yet its entropy is exactly constant along the chain.

The chain is the `a = b = 1` case of `Chains/TwoState.lean` and is rebuilt here
rather than imported, since `Techniques/` must not depend on `Chains/`;
`Techniques/UpDownDownUp.lean` keeps its counterexample locally for the same
reason.  It is the entropy analogue of the standing remark that a bipartite chain
has a spectral gap and does not converge — which is why `Techniques/Lazy.lean`
exists.  The difference is that laziness does *not* repair the present failure:

/-- **A modified log-Sobolev inequality does not imply entropy contraction, and
does not imply entropy decay of any kind.**

The swap chain on two states is reversible, satisfies `ModLogSobolev` with the
constant `1`, and yet its entropy is *exactly constant* along the chain: there is
a strictly positive `f` of positive entropy with `Ent_μ(P^t f) = Ent_μ(f)` for
every `t`.  Consequently `EntropyContraction μ P ρ` fails for every `ρ > 0`.

This is the entropy analogue of the standing observation of
`Techniques/Lazy.lean` that a bipartite chain has a spectral gap and does not
converge — with one difference.  There, laziness repairs the failure by supplying
positive semidefiniteness.  Here it cannot repair the *argument*:
`localEnt ≤ entropyProduction` holds for every reversible chain
(`localEnt_le_entropyProduction`) and is strict unless `P f = f`
(`act_eq_self_of_entropyProduction_le`), the lazy chain included, so no amount of
laziness turns a lower bound on the entropy production into a lower bound on the
entropy drop.  (It may of course repair the *conclusion*: the lazy swap chain is
the uniform independent sampler and destroys all entropy in one step.  Whether
some hypothesis on `P` makes `ModLogSobolev` imply `EntropyContraction` at a
comparable rate is left open here.)  The hypothesis that has to be assumed for
the results below is `EntropyContraction` itself. -/

/-! ## Crossing the boundary: from `f > 0` to `f ≥ 0`

`EntropyContraction` — like `ModLogSobolev` and `ApproxTensorizationEnt` — is
stated for strictly positive `f`, because the logarithms in its proofs are.  The
application, however, is at the relative density of a *point mass*, which
vanishes off one state.  The gap is closed by continuity: `Ent_μ` is continuous
in `f` (through `Real.continuous_mul_log`, the only place in this development
where a limit is taken), the shift `f ↦ f + ε` commutes with the action of a
kernel, and the inequality passes to the limit `ε → 0⁺`. -/

Specialising the decay to `f = ν/μ` turns `Ent` into `klDiv` by definition, and
`relDensity_push` turns the action of the chain on densities into the pushforward
of distributions.  The initial divergence from a point start is `log(1/μ(x))`,
where the χ² route pays `1/μ(x) − 1`; that single change is where the entropy
method earns its keep. -/

/-- **The entropy mixing-time bound.**  Let `P` be reversible with respect to a

`ρ ≤ 1`.  Then

  `D(P^t(x, ·) ‖ μ) ≤ ε`  as soon as  `ln (ln(1/m) / ε) ≤ ρ · t`,

i.e. after `t ≥ ρ⁻¹ · ln(ln(1/m)/ε)` steps.

**This is the point of the module.**  Compare the two competing bounds for the
same conclusion `D_KL ≤ ε`:

* the χ² route, `EntropyVariational.klDiv_iter_row_le_of_log_le`, needs
  `t ≥ (2(1−c))⁻¹ · ln(1/(ε m))`, i.e. `Θ(γ⁻¹ log(1/μ_min))`;
* this bound needs `t ≥ ρ⁻¹ · ln(ln(1/m)/ε)`, i.e. `Θ(ρ⁻¹ log log(1/μ_min))`.

For a spin system on `n` sites `log(1/μ_min) = Θ(n)`, so the first is `Θ(n)`
steps' worth of logarithm and the second `Θ(log n)`.  With a Glauber-shaped rate
`ρ = 1/(Cn)` (`entropyContraction_avg_of_tensorization`) that is the difference
between `O(n²)` and `O(n log n)` — the monograph's optimal mixing.

Two honesty notes.  First, `ρ` and the Poincaré constant `γ` are different
quantities and nothing here compares them; the improvement claimed is in the
*dependence on `μ_min`*, at equal rate.  Second, the conclusion is in relative
entropy, not total variation: converting it needs Pinsker's inequality, which
this development does not have (`tvDist_sq_le_chiSq` is the χ² analogue). -/

/-! ## Where entropy contraction comes from

Nothing above produces an `EntropyContraction`, and by
`exists_modLogSobolev_not_entropyContraction` a modified log-Sobolev inequality
will not produce one.  What does is *tensorization*, which is how the monograph
obtains the hypothesis in the first place: the entropy is controlled by the sum
of the local entropies of a family of chains, and the chain of interest is the
uniform average of that family.

The step that was missing is the concavity of `Ent` in the measure: the entropy
under an averaged row dominates the average of the entropies under the individual
rows.  That is one more application of `mul_log_sum_le_sum_mul_log`, now with the
uniform weights on the *index* type rather than on the state space. -/

/-- **Approximate tensorization of entropy implies entropy contraction for the
averaged chain**: if

  `Ent_μ(f) ≤ C · ∑ᵢ μ[Ent_{Kᵢ}(f)]`  for every `f > 0`,

then `avg K` contracts entropy at rate `1/(C |ι|)`.

This is the entropy-decay counterpart of
`GlauberTensorization.modLogSobolev_glauber_of_approxTensorizationEnt`, and it is
the statement that route should have proved: the same hypothesis, with a
conclusion that *iterates*.  No reversibility, stationarity or
positive-semidefiniteness is needed — only `localEnt_avg_ge`.

Instantiating it at `K = siteChain w hw` gives, verbatim from
`ApproxTensorizationEnt w hw hZ C` (whose right-hand side `∑ v, siteEnt … v f` is
by definition `∑ v, localEnt (gibbs w hw hZ) (siteChain w hw v) f`) and
`glauber w hw = FinKernel.avg (siteChain w hw)`,

  `EntropyContraction (gibbs w hw hZ) (glauber w hw) (1/(C n))`,

hence — with `approxTensorizationEnt_prodWeight`, i.e. `C = 1` — entropy decay at
rate `1/n` for the Glauber dynamics of a product measure, and by
`EntropyContraction.klDiv_iter_row_le_of_log_le` a mixing time of
`O(n · log(n/ε))` in relative entropy.  That corollary belongs in `Chains/` and
is not stated here. -/
