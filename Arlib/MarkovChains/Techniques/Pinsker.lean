# Pinsker's inequality: `2‖ν − μ‖²_TV ≤ D(ν ‖ μ)`

Every entropy estimate in this development is stated in relative entropy rather
than total variation, and both `Techniques/EntropyVariational.lean` and
`Techniques/EntropyDecay.lean` say so in as many words: the latter names the
missing conversion as the one thing standing between its mixing bound
`D(P^t(x, ·) ‖ μ) ≤ ε` and a `MixesWithin` statement.  The conversion is
Pinsker's inequality, and this module supplies it, **with the sharp constant**:

  `2 ‖ν − μ‖²_TV ≤ D(ν ‖ μ)`,  equivalently  `‖ν − μ‖_TV ≤ √(D(ν ‖ μ)/2)`.

The proof is the classical one — reduce to a scalar inequality, then integrate
it against `μ` — but arranged so that the reduction is *pointwise* rather than
through the two-point marginalisation, which is what keeps it short.  The engine
is a single scalar estimate,

  `(3/2)·(t − 1)² ≤ (t log t − t + 1)·(t + 2)`,   (★)

the division-free form of the Padé bound `t log t − t + 1 ≥ (3/2)(t−1)²/(t+2)`.
Both `(3/2)` and the `+2` are forced: they are exactly the choice for which (★)
agrees with `t log t − t + 1` to *third* order at `t = 1`, and any smaller shift
than `+2` makes (★) false near `t = 1`.  Linearising (★) with the tangent-line
trick at the slope `c = (2/3)‖ν − μ‖_TV` turns it into a bound that is *additive*
in `x`, so summing needs no Cauchy–Schwarz and no square roots — the optimal `c`
is written down rather than obtained from an inequality.

## Main declarations

* `one_sub_inv_le_log` — `1 − 1/t ≤ log t`, the elementary bound in the
  direction opposite to `Real.log_le_sub_one_of_pos`.
* **`two_mul_sub_le_add_one_mul_log`** / `add_one_mul_log_le_two_mul_sub` — the
  **Padé bound** `log t ≥ 2(t−1)/(t+1)` for `t ≥ 1`, and its reversal for
  `t ≤ 1`, in division-free form.  This is the sharpest bound on `log` that is
  needed anywhere below, and the reason a first-order bound such as
  `log t ≤ t − 1` cannot suffice: Pinsker's constant is second-order tight at
  `t = 1`.
* `klTerm a b = a(log a − log b) − a + b` — the pointwise relative-entropy term,
  with `klDiv_eq_sum_klTerm` identifying `D(ν ‖ μ)` with its sum.
* **`three_div_two_mul_sq_le_klTerm_mul`** — (★), in the homogeneous two-variable
  form `(3/2)(a − b)² ≤ klTerm a b · (a + 2b)`.
* **`lin_le_klTerm`** — its linearisation: for *every* real `c`,
  `3c|a − b| − (3/2)c²(a + 2b) ≤ klTerm a b`.  Summing this over `x` with
  `c` a constant is the whole of the reduction.
* **`two_mul_tvDist_sq_le_klDiv`** — **Pinsker's inequality**,
  `2‖ν − μ‖²_TV ≤ D(ν ‖ μ)`, and `tvDist_le_sqrt_klDiv` in root form.
* `two_mul_sub_sq_le_klTerm_add_klTerm` — the **two-point case** as a corollary
  of the same linearisation: `2(p − q)² ≤ p log(p/q) + (1−p) log((1−p)/(1−q))`.
  It is the form Pinsker is usually stated in, and it is recorded separately
  because it is reusable outside this development.
* **`mixesWithin_of_klDiv_le`**, `mixesWithin_of_klDiv_le_two_mul_sq` — the
  payoff: a bound on the relative entropy of the `t`-step law is a
  `MixesWithin` statement.  `Techniques/EntropyDecay.lean`'s
  `EntropyContraction.klDiv_iter_row_le_of_log_le` composes with the first of
  these in one line.

## Absolute continuity is not optional

Every statement about distributions carries `hac : ∀ x, μ x = 0 → ν x = 0`.  It
cannot be dropped: with `Real.log 0 = 0` and the guarded `relDensity`, the
divergence `klDiv ν μ` of a point mass from a *disjoint* point mass evaluates to
`0` while the total variation distance is `1`.  The hypothesis is the same one
`tvDist_sq_le_chiSq` carries, and in the mixing applications it is discharged by
`μ` being fully supported.

## Which chain to use

There are now two routes from an `L²`/entropy estimate to total variation, and
they are not interchangeable:

* `TotalVariation.tvDist_sq_le_chiSq` — `‖ν − μ‖_TV ≤ ½√(D_{χ²})`;
* this module — `‖ν − μ‖_TV ≤ √(D_KL/2)`.

Since `EntropyVariational.klDiv_le_chiSq` gives `D_KL ≤ D_{χ²}`, chaining
Pinsker after it yields `‖ν − μ‖_TV ≤ √(D_{χ²}/2)`, which is **worse than
`tvDist_sq_le_chiSq` by a factor of `√2`**.  So: if the bound in hand is a χ²
bound, use `tvDist_sq_le_chiSq` and do not pass through relative entropy.
Pinsker earns its place only on divergence bounds that are *not* obtained from
χ² — that is, on `EntropyDecay`'s entropy-contraction bounds, whose whole point
is that the initial divergence of a point mass is `log(1/μ_min)` rather than
`1/μ_min`.  The `√2` lost here is a constant; the gain there is a logarithm.

## Sharpness

The constant `2` is optimal: `D(ν ‖ μ) / ‖ν − μ‖²_TV → 2` for two-point
distributions with `p, q → 1/2`, where (★) and the tangent-line step are both
tight.  No claim of sharpness is *proved* here — that would need a limit — but
no constant larger than `2` is claimed either.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`.  No eigenvalue
appears.  The one departure from the area's usual diet is the pair of imports
`Mathlib.Analysis.Calculus.MeanValue` and
`Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Log.Deriv`: two derivatives are computed and
three monotonicity arguments are run, all on explicit one-variable functions of
`Real.log`, and nothing else analytic is used.  That departure is not avoidable
— see the note opening the next section for why `log t ≤ t − 1`, the sole
analytic input of `Techniques/Entropy.lean`, provably cannot reach the constant
`2`.

/-! ## Two scalar bounds on the logarithm

`Techniques/Entropy.lean` is built entirely on `log t ≤ t − 1`.  That bound is
first-order tight at `t = 1` and no better, and Pinsker's inequality is
*second-order* tight there, so it cannot be reached from `log t ≤ t − 1` by any
amount of rearrangement.  (Concretely: iterating `log t = 2 log √t ≥ 2(1 − 1/√t)`
converges to `log t`, but every finite iterate has a second-order defect at
`t = 1`, which is precisely the order at which Pinsker is tight.)

What is needed instead is the Padé bound `log t ≥ 2(t−1)/(t+1)`, whose defect at
`t = 1` is of third order.  It is proved here by a mean-value argument — the
derivative of `(t+1) log t − 2(t−1)` is `log t + 1/t − 1 ≥ 0`, which is the
*elementary* bound again — and it is the only place in this file where anything
is differentiated other than the function of `three_div_two_mul_sq_le_mul_log`. -/

/-! ## The scalar Padé estimate for `t log t − t + 1`

The function `φ(t) = t log t − t + 1` is the pointwise relative entropy in
normalised form: `φ ≥ 0`, `φ(1) = 0`, and `φ(t) = (t−1)²/2 + O((t−1)³)`.  The
estimate below replaces it by a rational function agreeing with it to third
order at `t = 1`.

Its proof is the second and last mean-value argument: the derivative of
`φ(t)(t+2) − (3/2)(t−1)²` is exactly `2·((t+1) log t − 2(t−1))`, the Padé
quantity of the previous section, so its sign is the sign of `t − 1` and the
function has a minimum at `t = 1`, where it vanishes. -/

/-- The derivative of `t ↦ (t log t − t + 1)(t + 2) − (3/2)(t − 1)²` is

`κ < 2` makes the `s³` terms disagree in the wrong direction and the statement
false near `t = 1`; and the pairing of `κ = 2` with `3/2` is exactly what makes

`klTerm a b` is the summand of the relative entropy in its "already centred"
form: the linear correction `−a + b` sums to zero over a pair of probability
distributions, so adding it changes nothing, but it is what makes the pointwise
estimate below true for each `x` separately. -/

The linear part `−a + b` sums to zero against two distributions
(`klDiv_eq_sum_klTerm`), so it is invisible in the divergence; pointwise it is
what makes `klTerm a b ≥ 0` and what makes the Padé estimate below hold term by
term.  The Mathlib convention `Real.log 0 = 0` makes `klTerm 0 b = b`, which is
the correct value, and `klTerm a 0 = a log a − a` — a value that is *not*
`+∞`, which is why every distributional statement below carries an
absolute-continuity hypothesis. -/

The left side is a linear function of the pair `(|a − b|, a + 2b)`, so summing
it over `x` needs only that `∑ |ν x − μ x| = 2‖ν − μ‖_TV` and
`∑ (ν x + 2 μ x) = 3`.  This replaces the Cauchy–Schwarz step of the textbook
proof: the optimal slope `c = (2/3)‖ν − μ‖_TV` is written down rather than

/-! ## Pinsker's inequality

The divergence is the sum of the pointwise terms, and the linearised estimate is
summed at the slope `c = (2/3)‖ν − μ‖_TV`.  The two `∑`s that appear are the
definition of `tvDist` and the fact that `ν` and `μ` are probability
distributions; nothing else enters. -/

/-- The relative entropy is the sum of the pointwise terms:

  `D(ν ‖ μ) = ∑ x, (ν x (log ν x − log μ x) − ν x + μ x)`.

The linear correction contributes `−1 + 1 = 0`, so this is the usual formula;
what it buys is a summand to which `lin_le_klTerm` applies term by term. -/

/-- **Pinsker's inequality**, with the sharp constant:

`hac` is essential and not a technicality — see the module docstring.

The proof sums `lin_le_klTerm` at the slope `c = (2/3)‖ν − μ‖_TV`.  Writing
`τ = ‖ν − μ‖_TV`, the summed left-hand side is
`3c·(2τ) − (3/2)c²·3 = 6cτ − (9/2)c²`, whose maximum over `c` is at
`c = (2/3)τ` with value `4τ² − 2τ² = 2τ²`.  Both the `2` and the fact that the
optimum is interior come from the constants of

/-! ## The two-point case

The scalar inequality Pinsker is usually stated as.  It is *not* used above —
the reduction there is pointwise, not through a two-point marginalisation — but
it is the reusable core of the subject, and deriving it from the same
linearisation is a check that the pointwise route and the classical one agree.

The linear parts of the two `klTerm`s cancel, so the right-hand side below is
literally `p log(p/q) + (1−p) log((1−p)/(1−q))`. -/

/-- **Pinsker's inequality, two-point case.**  For `p, q ∈ [0, 1]` with
`q ∈ {0, 1}` only when `p` agrees,

  `2(p − q)² ≤ p log(p/q) + (1−p) log((1−p)/(1−q))`.

The right-hand side is written as `klTerm p q + klTerm (1−p) (1−q)`; the two
linear corrections `−p + q` and `−(1−p) + (1−q)` cancel exactly, so this is the
usual two-point relative entropy.

The side conditions are the absolute-continuity hypothesis for the two-point
distributions `(p, 1−p)` and `(q, 1−q)`, and they cannot be dropped: at `q = 0`,
`p = 1` the left side is `2` and the right side, with `Real.log 0 = 0`,
evaluates to `0`.

The proof applies `lin_le_klTerm` to each of the two cells at the common slope
`c = (2/3)|p − q|` and adds; the masses `p + 2q` and `(1−p) + 2(1−q)` sum to
`3`, exactly as the distributional masses do. -/

/-! ## Cashing it: relative entropy bounds become mixing-time bounds

This is what the module exists for.  `Techniques/EntropyDecay.lean` proves
`EntropyContraction.klDiv_iter_row_le_of_log_le`:

  `D(P^t(x, ·) ‖ μ) ≤ ε`  once  `t ≥ ρ⁻¹ ln(ln(1/μ_min)/ε)`,

and remarks that converting it to total variation needs Pinsker.  Feeding that
theorem to `mixesWithin_of_klDiv_le` below does exactly that, and gives

  `MixesWithin P μ (√(ε/2)) t`,

i.e. a genuine mixing time of `ρ⁻¹ ln(ln(1/μ_min)/ε)` steps for total variation
distance `√(ε/2)` — equivalently, `T_mix(δ) ≤ ρ⁻¹ ln(ln(1/μ_min)/(2δ²))`, which
is the form `mixesWithin_of_klDiv_le_two_mul_sq` states.  Nothing in this
section is specific to entropy contraction: any source of a divergence bound
will do. -/
