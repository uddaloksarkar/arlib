# Conductance and the easy direction of Cheeger's inequality

The spectral gap is a global analytic quantity: to bound it one must control
`ℰ_P(f)` against `Var_μ(f)` for *every* `f`.  Conductance is the combinatorial
shadow of the same idea, and it is something one can actually estimate on a
concrete chain by counting: the probability, in stationarity, that a single step
escapes a set `A`, normalised by the probability of `A`.  A set with small
conductance is a bottleneck, and a bottleneck forces slow mixing.

That implication — the *easy* half of Cheeger's inequality — is exactly the
Poincaré inequality evaluated at one particular test function, the indicator of
`A`.  For that `f` the Dirichlet form *is* the cut (`dirichlet_indicator`) and
the variance *is* `Pr(A)(1 - Pr(A))` (`Var_indicator`), so the Poincaré
inequality reads off as a bound on `γ` with no analysis at all.  This makes the
module a good fit for the no-eigenvalue discipline of this development (ROADMAP
§1.2), and it gives `Chains/` modules the tool they need to certify *lower*
bounds on mixing time.  The hard direction of Cheeger genuinely needs more
machinery and is deliberately out of scope here.

* `flow μ P A B` — the stationary ergodic flow `∑_{x ∈ A} ∑_{y ∈ B} μ(x) P(x,y)`
  from `A` to `B`, with `flow_univ_right`, `flow_univ_left_of_stationary`, and
  **`flow_comm`** — detailed balance summed over a rectangle.  `flow_comm` is
  the one and only place reversibility enters this file.
* `cut μ P A = flow μ P A Aᶜ` — the probability of crossing the cut in one step,
  and `cut_eq_Pr_sub`.
* **`dirichlet_indicator`** — for `f` the indicator of `A` and `P` reversible,
  `ℰ_P(f) = cut μ P A`.  Its stationary-only precursor
  `dirichlet_indicator_eq_flow_add` gives the symmetrised form
  `½(flow A Aᶜ + flow Aᶜ A)`.
* `Var_indicator` — `Var_μ(1_A) = Pr(A)(1 - Pr(A))`, needing no hypothesis on
  `μ` or `P` at all.
* `conductance μ P A = cut μ P A / Pr μ A`, with `conductance_nonneg` and
  `conductance_le_one`.
* **`spectralGap_mul_le_cut`** — `γ · Pr(A)(1 - Pr(A)) ≤ cut μ P A`, the
  un-normalised statement, with no constraint whatsoever on `Pr(A)`.
* **`spectralGap_le_conductance`** — the headline: for `0 < Pr(A) ≤ ½` and
  `0 ≤ γ`, a chain with spectral gap at least `γ` satisfies `γ ≤ 2 Φ(A)`.
* `not_spectralGapAtLeast_of_lt` — the contrapositive, which is the shape a
  slow-mixing argument actually applies.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`.

step of the chain leaves `A`.  It is the numerator of the conductance and, by
`dirichlet_indicator`, the Dirichlet form of the indicator of `A`. -/

/-! ## The Dirichlet form and the variance of an indicator

Both halves of the Poincaré inequality can be evaluated in closed form at the
indicator of a set.  This is the entire content of the easy direction of
Cheeger's inequality; the rest is arithmetic. -/

/-- **Symmetrised form of the Dirichlet form of an indicator.**  For a
*stationary* `μ`,
`ℰ_P(1_A) = ½ (flow μ P A Aᶜ + flow μ P Aᶜ A)`.

In the pair form `½ ∑_{x,y} μ(x) P(x,y) (1_A x - 1_A y)²` the summand is
`μ(x) P(x,y)` when exactly one of `x`, `y` lies in `A`, and `0` otherwise; the
two ways of "exactly one" are the two flows. -/

Reversibility is used exactly once, to identify the two flows across the cut
(`flow_comm`); without it one still has the symmetrised
`dirichlet_indicator_eq_flow_add`, which needs only stationarity. -/

/-! ## The easy direction of Cheeger's inequality

Instantiate the Poincaré inequality at the indicator of `A`.  The left-hand side
is `γ · Pr(A)(1 - Pr(A))` by `Var_indicator` and the right-hand side is
`cut μ P A` by `dirichlet_indicator`; that is the whole proof.  The hard
direction of Cheeger — a small gap forces a small cut — is not proved here and
is out of scope for this module. -/

/-- **A bottleneck bounds the gap, un-normalised form.**  If `P` is reversible
with respect to `μ` and has spectral gap at least `γ`, then for *every* set `A`

`γ · Pr(A) (1 - Pr(A)) ≤ cut μ P A`.

There is no constraint on `Pr(A)` and no sign condition on `γ`; this is simply
the Poincaré inequality read at `f = 1_A`, and it is the form a `Chains/` module
will apply. -/

/-- **The easy direction of Cheeger's inequality.**  Let `P` be reversible with

gap at least `γ ≥ 0`.  Then

`γ ≤ 2 Φ(A)`,

where `Φ(A) = conductance μ P A`.  A set with small conductance is a bottleneck,
and a bottleneck caps the gap; contrapositively (`not_spectralGapAtLeast_of_lt`)
exhibiting one bad cut certifies slow mixing.

The proof is the Poincaré inequality at `f = 1_A` together with
`1 - Pr(A) ≥ ½`.  No eigenvalue appears, and the only use of reversibility is
`flow_comm`. -/
