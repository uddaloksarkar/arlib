# Comparison of chains, and the gap of an iterate

Almost no spectral gap is ever computed.  What one does instead is *transfer* a
gap: take a chain whose Poincaré constant is known, show that the chain one
actually cares about has a Dirichlet form at least comparable to it, and read
off a gap for free.  This is the comparison method, and it is the reason a
module in `Chains/` can bound a gap without ever evaluating a sum.

The method is completely elementary here, and that is the point of the pair form
`dirichlet_self_eq_pair`: both Dirichlet forms are finite sums
`½ ∑_{x,y} μ(x) · K(x,y) · (f x - f y)²` over the *same* index set with the
*same* weights `μ(x) (f x - f y)²`, so domination of one form by the other is a
term-by-term inequality between the kernels — and only off the diagonal, since
the diagonal terms carry the factor `(f x - f x)² = 0`.

* `DirichletLe μ P Q A` — `ℰ_P(f) ≤ A · ℰ_Q(f)` for every `f`; "`Q` dominates
  `P` with constant `A`".  Reflexive with `A = 1`, and composes by multiplying
  constants.
* `spectralGapAtLeast_of_dirichletLe` — **the comparison theorem**: if `Q`
  dominates `P` with constant `A > 0` and `P` has gap `γ`, then `Q` has gap
  `γ / A`.  It is `Q` that inherits the gap, because `Q`'s Dirichlet form is the
  larger one.
* `dirichletLe_of_entrywise` — **the practical criterion**: for `μ` stationary
  for both chains, an entrywise bound `P(x,y) ≤ A · Q(x,y)` *off the diagonal*
  suffices.  The diagonal is genuinely irrelevant, which is what makes the
  criterion usable: laziness, holding probabilities and self-loops may be
  changed at will.
* `absSpectralBound_mono`, `comp_reversible`, `iter_reversible` — the small API
  needed to iterate.
* `absSpectralBound_iter` — **the absolute spectral bound of an iterate**:
  `AbsSpectralBound μ P c` with `0 ≤ c` gives `AbsSpectralBound μ (P^t) (c^t)`,
  and hence `spectralGapAtLeast_iter`, the Poincaré inequality for `P^t` with
  constant `1 - c^t`.  The proof runs the operator bound `ip_act_sq_le` `t`
  times to control `‖P^t f‖`, then applies Cauchy–Schwarz once; no eigenvalue,
  and in particular no "the eigenvalues of `P^t` are the `t`-th powers of those
  of `P`", is involved.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`.

/-! ## Domination of Dirichlet forms -/

/-- `Q` **dominates** `P` **with constant** `A`: `ℰ_P(f) ≤ A · ℰ_Q(f)` for every
`f`.

This is the hypothesis of the comparison method.  Note the asymmetry of the
roles: the chain on the *right* has the bigger Dirichlet form, hence moves faster
and, by `spectralGapAtLeast_of_dirichletLe`, inherits a gap from the chain on the
left. -/

/-! ## Transfer of the spectral gap

The comparison theorem itself, which is one line of division once the two
Poincaré inequalities are lined up. -/

/-- **The comparison theorem.**  If `Q` dominates `P` with constant `A > 0` and
`P` satisfies the Poincaré inequality with constant `γ`, then `Q` satisfies it
with constant `γ / A`:

`(γ/A) · Var_μ(f) ≤ ℰ_Q(f)`, since `γ · Var_μ(f) ≤ ℰ_P(f) ≤ A · ℰ_Q(f)`.

This is the whole method.  The gap flows from the slower chain to the faster
one, and the loss is exactly the comparison constant. -/

/-! ## The entrywise criterion

In practice one never verifies `DirichletLe` directly; one compares the two
transition matrices entry by entry.  The pair form turns the comparison of the
forms into exactly that, and only off the diagonal: the terms with `x = y` carry
the factor `(f x - f x)² = 0` on both sides. -/

/-- **The entrywise comparison criterion.**  Let `μ` be stationary for both `P`
and `Q`, and suppose `P(x,y) ≤ A · Q(x,y)` for all `x ≠ y`.  Then `Q` dominates
`P` with constant `A`.

Only the *off-diagonal* entries are constrained.  This is what makes the
criterion applicable: the diagonal of a transition matrix records the holding
probability, which a Dirichlet form cannot see. -/

/-! ## Stationarity and reversibility of composites

Stationarity passes to any composite.  Reversibility does *not*: detailed balance
for `P ∘ₖ Q` unwinds to `μ(x) (PQ)(x,z) = μ(z) (QP)(z,x)`, so one needs the two
chains to commute.  They do in the case that matters, `P` with its own iterate,
which is `FinKernel.iter_succ'`. -/

/-- **Reversibility of a composite of commuting reversible chains.**

/-! ## The absolute spectral bound of an iterate

The `L²(μ)` norm of `P^t f` is controlled by running the operator bound
`ip_act_sq_le` once per step; the numerical range of `P^t` then follows from a
single application of Cauchy–Schwarz.  This replaces the textbook step "the
eigenvalues of `P^t` are the `t`-th powers of those of `P`". -/

/-- **Iterated operator bound.**  For `P` reversible with absolute spectral
bound `c` and `f` mean-zero, `⟪P^t f, P^t f⟫_μ ≤ (c²)^t ⟪f, f⟫_μ`.

This is the `L²(μ)`-norm statement; it is the same induction as `Var_iter_le`,
carried out at the level of the inner product so that it can be fed to
Cauchy–Schwarz. -/
