# The entropy functional `Ent_μ(f)` and modified log-Sobolev inequalities

The spectral gap controls the decay of *variance*, and variance decay converts
into a mixing-time bound only at the cost of a factor `log(1/μ_min)`: the χ²
divergence of a point mass from `μ` is `1/μ(x) - 1`, so the number of steps
needed is `γ⁻¹ · log(1/μ_min)` (see `mixesWithin_of_log_le`).  For a spin system
on `n` sites `μ_min` is exponentially small in `n`, so `log(1/μ_min) = Θ(n)` and
the resulting bound is `O(n²)` — off by a factor of `n` from the truth.

The fix, and the route the monograph takes to *optimal* `O(n log n)` mixing, is
to replace variance by **entropy**.  The entropy functional
`Ent_μ(f) = μ(f log f) - μ(f) log μ(f)` plays exactly the role `Var_μ(f)` plays
in the `L²` theory — it is nonnegative, vanishes on constants, and is compared
to a Dirichlet form — but it is *linearly* homogeneous rather than quadratically
so, and the divergence it produces (the Kullback–Leibler divergence, rather than
χ²) is only `log(1/μ_min)` rather than `1/μ_min` for a point mass.  That single
change is what removes the spurious factor of `n`.

This module builds the functional as the exact analogue of `Var`:

* `mul_log_le_mul_log_add_sub`, `mul_log_lt_mul_log_add_sub` — the pointwise
  inequality `t log m ≤ t log t + (m - t)`, and its strict form.  Everything
  analytic in this file is a consequence of these; they are in turn immediate
  from `Real.log_le_sub_one_of_pos` applied to `m / t`.  No convexity API, no
  Jensen machinery, no measure theory.
* `mul_log_le_mul_log_add_sq_div` — the *other* evaluation of `log u ≤ u − 1`,
  at `u = t/m` rather than `u = m/t`.  It is what
  `EntropyVariational.Ent_le_Var_div` consumes.
* `mul_log_sum_le_sum_mul_log` — **Jensen's inequality for `t ↦ t log t`** in
  the only form we need: for weights `p` summing to `1` and `a ≥ 0`,
  `(∑ p a) log (∑ p a) ≤ ∑ p (a log a)`.  Applied with `p = μ` it is
  `Ent_nonneg`; applied with `p` a *row of the transition kernel* it is the
  one-step contraction `Ent_act_le`.
* **`mul_log_sub_log_sum_le`** — **the log-sum inequality**, the two-function
  refinement of the previous item: `A log(A/B) ≤ ∑ pᵢ aᵢ log(aᵢ/bᵢ)`.  With
  `mul_log_sub_log_act_le` and `Ex_mul_log_sub_log_act_le` it gives data
  processing for the relative entropy of a *pair* of functions along a kernel,
  which is what entropy tensorization runs on.
* `Ent`, `Ent_apply`, `Ent_const`, **`Ent_nonneg`**, `Ent_smul`,
  `eq_Ex_of_Ent_eq_zero` — the functional and its basic calculus.
* `ModLogSobolev μ P ρ` — the modified log-Sobolev inequality, deliberately the
  exact analogue of `SpectralGapAtLeast` with `Ent` in place of `Var`.
* `naiveModLogSobolev_le_zero` — **a warning**: with the Dirichlet form `ℰ(f, f)` on
  the right-hand side, that analogy is *false*, and the definition above is
  vacuous for `ρ > 0`.  Entropy is `1`-homogeneous and `ℰ(f, f)` is
  `2`-homogeneous, so testing the inequality at `c · f` and letting `c → 0`
  forces `ρ · Ent_μ(f) ≤ 0`.  The genuine modified log-Sobolev inequality has
  the *entropy production* `ℰ(f, log f)` on the right, which is `1`-homogeneous
  up to the additive `log c`; that functional is not developed here.
* **`Ent_act_le`** — entropy is non-increasing along any stationary chain,
  `Ent_μ(P f) ≤ Ent_μ(f)`, together with its iterate `Ent_act_iter_le`.  This is
  the honest discrete-time statement; the geometric decay
  `Ent_μ(P f) ≤ (1 - ρ) Ent_μ(f)` is *not* proved here, and does not follow from
  `ModLogSobolev` as defined above (see `naiveModLogSobolev_le_zero`).
* `localEnt μ P f` — the **mean conditional entropy** `μ[Ent_{P(σ,·)}(f)]`, the
  entropy analogue of `GlauberTensorization.siteVar`, with
  `localEnt_eq_Ent_sub_Ent` (it collapses to `Ent_μ(f) − Ent_μ(P f)`) and
  **`localEnt_le_entropyProduction`**, valid for *any* reversible chain.
  `Ent_sub_Ent_act_of_invariant` rewrites the same entropy drop as a divergence
  whenever `log (P g)` is `P`-invariant.
* `klDiv ν μ = Ent_μ(ν/μ)` — the Kullback–Leibler divergence, with
  `klDiv_nonneg` and the data-processing bound `klDiv_push_le`, mirroring
  `chiSq_nonneg` and `chiSq_push_le` in `Arlib.MarkovChains.Techniques.SpectralGap`.

No eigenvalue, and no spectral notion beyond the Dirichlet form itself, appears
anywhere in this file.  Everything here is proved from first principles with no
`sorry`.

/-! ## The pointwise inequality

Every analytic statement below is a consequence of `log x ≤ x - 1`, applied at
`x = m / t`, multiplied through by `t` and rearranged.  Recording it once in the
rearranged form `t log m ≤ t log t + (m - t)` keeps the rest of the file
algebraic.  Note the convention `Real.log 0 = 0`, which is what makes the
degenerate case `t = 0` work out to the harmless `0 ≤ m`. -/

/-- The **fundamental pointwise inequality** behind the entropy functional: for
`m > 0` and `t ≥ 0`,
`t · log m ≤ t · log t + (m - t)`.

Taking `μ`-expectations of this with `m = μ(f)` and `t = f y` makes the linear
term `(m - t)` integrate to zero and leaves exactly `Ent_nonneg`. -/

/-! ## Jensen's inequality for `t ↦ t log t`

The single convexity fact this development needs, in the weighted finite-sum
form.  It is stated for an arbitrary probability weight vector `p` rather than
for a `FinDist`, because it is used twice with two different weight vectors: the
stationary distribution `μ` (giving `Ent_nonneg`) and a *row* `P x ·` of the
transition kernel (giving the one-step contraction of entropy). -/

/-- **Jensen's inequality for `t ↦ t log t`.**  For nonnegative weights `p`
summing to `1` and a nonnegative `a`,
`(∑ p a) · log (∑ p a) ≤ ∑ p · (a log a)`.

The proof is the pointwise bound `mul_log_le_mul_log_add_sub` at
`m = ∑ p a` and `t = a y`, summed against `p`; the linear correction term
telescopes to `(∑ p a) · (∑ p) - (∑ p a) = 0`. -/

/-! ## The log-sum inequality

The ingredient the entropy tensorization of `Chains/ProductEntropy.lean` needs
and the variance argument does not.  It is *not* a new inequality: it is
`mul_log_le_mul_log_add_sub` — the `t log m ≤ t log t + (m − t)` above —
evaluated at `t = a/b` and `m = (∑ p a)/(∑ p b)` and summed against the weights
`p b`.

The convention throughout is to write `log a − log b` rather than `log (a/b)`,
which keeps the `Real.log_div` side conditions in one place. -/

/-- **The log-sum inequality.**  For a probability weight vector `p` and
strictly positive `a`, `b`,

  `(∑ p a) · (log (∑ p a) − log (∑ p b)) ≤ ∑ p · a · (log a − log b)`.

Equivalently `A log (A/B) ≤ ∑ pᵢ aᵢ log (aᵢ/bᵢ)`: the relative entropy of the
aggregated pair is at most the aggregate of the pointwise relative entropies.
This is the convexity fact that entropy tensorization needs and variance
tensorization does not; taking `b ≡ 1` recovers `mul_log_sum_le_sum_mul_log`.

The proof is the pointwise bound `mul_log_le_mul_log_add_sub` at `t = aᵢ/bᵢ`,
`m = A/B`, multiplied by `pᵢ bᵢ ≥ 0`; the linear correction sums to
`(A/B)·B − A = 0`. -/

This is the entropy of a *function against a distribution*, not the Shannon
entropy of a distribution; it is the entropy analogue of `Var μ f`, and the two
occupy the same place in the theory.  The one structural difference is
homogeneity: `Var` is quadratic (`Var_μ(c f) = c² Var_μ(f)`) whereas `Ent` is
*linear* (`Ent_smul`).  That difference is the whole point — it is why the
entropy route loses only `log log (1/μ_min)` where the `L²` route loses
`log (1/μ_min)`. -/

In particular the inequality carries no information for `ρ > 0`: it then says
`Ent_μ(f) = 0` for all `f ≥ 0`, which happens only in the degenerate case.  The
reason is pure homogeneity — `Ent_μ(c f) = c · Ent_μ(f)` while
`ℰ_P(c f, c f) = c² ℰ_P(f, f)`, so testing at `c f` gives
`ρ · Ent_μ(f) ≤ c · ℰ_P(f, f)` for *every* `c > 0`, and the right-hand side can
be made arbitrarily small.  This is why the modified log-Sobolev inequality of
the literature pairs `Ent_μ(f)` with the entropy production `ℰ_P(f, log f)`,
which scales the same way. -/

/-! ## Entropy decay along the chain

The one-step statement that is genuinely true in discrete time is that entropy
is *non-increasing*.  Its proof is Jensen's inequality for `t ↦ t log t` applied
to the row `P x ·` of the kernel — that is, `mul_log_sum_le_sum_mul_log` again,
with the kernel row in place of `μ` — combined with the fact that stationarity
preserves `μ`-expectations, which handles both the `μ(f) log μ(f)` term and the
`μ(P (f log f)) = μ(f log f)` step.

We do *not* prove a geometric decay `Ent_μ(P f) ≤ (1 - ρ) Ent_μ(f)`.  The clean
statement of that kind belongs to the continuous-time semigroup, where the
derivative of the entropy is exactly the entropy production; the discrete-time
version needs an extra hypothesis, and in any case it cannot be deduced from
`ModLogSobolev` as defined above, by `naiveModLogSobolev_le_zero`. -/

`localEnt μ P f` is the entropy analogue of `GlauberTensorization.siteVar`: draw
`σ` from `μ`, take the entropy of `f` with respect to the *row* `P(σ, ·)`, and
average.  Where the variance version can be defined as a Dirichlet form, we
cannot — entropy is not a quadratic form — so the definition is the average of
row entropies, and `localEnt_eq_Ent_sub_Ent` shows it collapses to the difference
`Ent_μ(f) − Ent_μ(P f)` exactly as `siteVar` collapses to `⟪f,f⟫ − ⟪Pf, Pf⟫`. -/

`ℰ_P(f, log f) − μ[Ent_P(f)]` into `μ[(P f) · (log (P f) − log f)]`, which is the
relative entropy of the pair `(P f, f)`; stationarity says the two have the same
`μ`-mean, so the log-sum inequality bounds it below by `μ(f) · log 1 = 0`.

Note what is *not* needed: no idempotence, no product structure, no
positive-semidefiniteness — only detailed balance. -/

/-- **The relative-entropy form of the entropy drop.**  If `P` is reversible and
`log (P g)` is `P`-invariant then

  `Ent_μ(g) − Ent_μ(P g) = μ[g · (log g − log (P g))]`.

The invariance hypothesis is genuine and is not implied by idempotence: it says
`P g` is constant along the rows of `P`, which for a resampling kernel holds
because `P g` does not depend on the resampled coordinates at all
(`act_prodProj_fix`).  Given it, self-adjointness moves the weight from `P g` to
`g` in the term `μ[(P g) log (P g)]`, which is precisely what turns a difference
of entropies into a divergence, and hence what makes the data-processing
inequality applicable. -/
