# The variational principle for entropy, and `D_KL ≤ D_{χ²}`

`Arlib.MarkovChains.Techniques.Entropy` builds the entropy functional `Ent_μ(f)`
and the divergence `klDiv` it produces, but leaves them stranded: every
*quantitative* mixing estimate in the development is stated for the χ²-divergence
(`chiSq_iter_le`, `tvDist_iter_row_le`, `mixesWithin_lazy_of_gap`), and nothing so
far connects the two functionals.  This module supplies the connection, and it is
a one-way street with a very cheap toll:

  **`Ent_μ(f) ≤ Var_μ(f) / μ(f)`**, hence **`D_KL(ν ‖ μ) ≤ D_{χ²}(ν ‖ μ)`**.

Every existing χ² bound therefore upgrades, for free, to a bound in relative
entropy — `klDiv_iter_row_le` and `klDiv_iter_row_lazy_le_of_log_le` below are the
entropy analogues of `tvDist_iter_row_le` and `mixesWithin_lazy_of_gap`.

*Honest caveat.*  This does **not** deliver the `O(n log n)` mixing that motivates
the entropy method in the monograph.  Bounding KL by χ² inherits the χ² route's
`log(1/μ_min)` loss verbatim; the gain of the entropy method comes from decaying
`Ent` directly, which needs a modified log-Sobolev inequality
(`ModLogSobolev`).  What this module provides is the *statement* in the right
currency, and the variational machinery that a genuine entropy-decay argument
consumes.

Main declarations:

* `mul_le_mul_log_sub_add_exp` — **Young's inequality for entropy**:
  `x y ≤ x log x − x + exp y` for `x ≥ 0`.  This is the only genuinely analytic
  ingredient of the module; it is `u + 1 ≤ exp u` at `u = y − log x`, and
  everything else is bookkeeping on top of it.
* `mul_le_mul_log_sub_mul_log_add_mul_exp` — the mean-normalised form, which is
  the shape actually summed against `μ`.
* **`Ex_mul_le_Ent`** — the *bound* half of the Gibbs variational principle:
  `μ(f g) ≤ Ent_μ(f)` for every `g` with `μ(e^g) ≤ 1`.
* `gibbsWitness`, `Ex_exp_gibbsWitness`, **`Ex_mul_gibbsWitness`** — the
  *attainment* half: `g = log f − log μ(f)` is admissible and achieves the
  bound.  This half genuinely needs `f > 0` pointwise, and says so.
* `gibbsSet`, `isGreatest_gibbsSet`, `Ent_eq_sSup` — the two halves assembled
  into `Ent_μ(f) = sup {μ(f g) : μ(e^g) ≤ 1}`.
* **`Ent_le_Var_div`** — **entropy is dominated by variance**,
  `Ent_μ(f) ≤ Var_μ(f) / μ(f)`.  Both sides are `1`-homogeneous in `f`, as they
  must be (compare `naiveModLogSobolev_le_zero`).
* **`klDiv_le_chiSq`** — the headline: `D_KL(ν ‖ μ) ≤ D_{χ²}(ν ‖ μ)`.
* `klDiv_iter_row_le`, `klDiv_iter_row_lazy_le`,
  **`klDiv_iter_row_lazy_le_of_log_le`** — the payoff, cashed: the KL divergence
  of the `t`-step law from a deterministic start decays at the χ² rate, and the
  lazy chain with Poincaré constant `γ` has `D_KL ≤ ε` once `γ t ≥ ln(1/(ε m))`.

No eigenvalue appears anywhere.  Everything here is proved from first principles
with no `sorry`.

/-! ## Young's inequality for entropy

The Legendre duality between `x ↦ x log x − x` and `y ↦ exp y`, in the only form
this development needs.  It is the single analytic input of the module: the
variational principle, the comparison with variance and the KL/χ² inequality are
all obtained by summing it against `μ` and rearranging.

Note the convention `Real.log 0 = 0`, which makes the boundary case `x = 0`
degenerate to the harmless `0 ≤ exp y`. -/

/-- **Young's inequality for entropy.**  For `x ≥ 0` and any real `y`,

  `x · y ≤ x log x − x + exp y`.

For `x > 0` this is `u + 1 ≤ exp u` (`Real.add_one_le_exp`) at `u = y − log x`,
multiplied through by `x`; for `x = 0` it is `0 ≤ exp y`. -/

/-! ## The Gibbs variational principle: the bound

Summing Young's inequality against `μ` gives one half of the variational
principle, and it needs nothing beyond `f ≥ 0`: the case `μ(f) = 0` is genuinely
degenerate (then `μ`-almost every value of `f` is `0`, and both sides vanish)
rather than excluded. -/

/-- **The Gibbs variational principle, bound half.**  For `f ≥ 0` and any `g`
with `μ(e^g) ≤ 1`,

  `μ(f g) ≤ Ent_μ(f)`.

This is `mul_le_mul_log_sub_mul_log_add_mul_exp` at `m = μ(f)` summed against
`μ`: the `−(log m + 1)·f` term integrates to `−m log m − m`, the `m · e^g` term
contributes at most `m`, and the two `m`'s cancel, leaving exactly
`μ(f log f) − m log m = Ent_μ(f)`.

The homogeneity is consistent: replacing `f` by `c f` multiplies both sides by
`c`, and the admissible set of `g`'s does not move. -/

/-! ## The Gibbs variational principle: attainment

The extremal `g` is `log f − log μ(f)`, i.e. `e^g = f / μ(f)`.  Unlike the bound
half, this genuinely requires `f` to be *strictly* positive: on the zero set of
`f` the density `f/μ(f)` vanishes and no real `g` has `e^g = 0`.  We state the
hypothesis rather than work around it. -/

Together with `Ex_mul_le_Ent` this says the entropy *is* the supremum, and it is
attained.  Note that *this* identity is unconditional — it is the definition of
`Ent` rearranged.  Positivity of `f` is needed only for the companion statement
`Ex_exp_gibbsWitness`, i.e. only to know that the witness is *admissible*; that
is the honest location of the hypothesis. -/

/-! ## Entropy is dominated by variance

The payoff of the module.  It rests on a *second* pointwise inequality,
`Entropy.mul_log_le_mul_log_add_sq_div`: `Techniques.Entropy` records
`mul_log_le_mul_log_add_sub`, which is `log u ≤ u − 1` at `u = m/t`, the
direction giving `Ent ≥ 0`; here we need the *opposite* evaluation,
`log u ≤ u − 1` at `u = t/m`, which is a genuinely new instance of
`Real.log_le_sub_one_of_pos` rather than a corollary of the existing one.

Homogeneity check, in the spirit of `naiveModLogSobolev_le_zero`: `Ent` is
`1`-homogeneous, `Var` is `2`-homogeneous and `μ(f)` is `1`-homogeneous, so
`Var_μ(f)/μ(f)` is `1`-homogeneous.  The two sides scale together, as they must
for the inequality to have content. -/

/-- **Entropy is dominated by variance**: for `f ≥ 0` with positive mean,

  `Ent_μ(f) ≤ Var_μ(f) / μ(f)`.

Both sides are linearly homogeneous in `f`.  The proof is `log t ≤ t − 1` at
`t = f/μ(f)`: it turns `Ent_μ(f) = μ(f log(f/μ f))` into
`μ(f · (f/μ(f) − 1)) = μ(f²)/μ(f) − μ(f) = Var_μ(f)/μ(f)`.

This is the inequality that makes the entropy functional usable against the
existing `L²` machinery: it is the bridge from `chiSq` to `klDiv`. -/

/-! ## `D_KL ≤ D_{χ²}`

Instantiating `Ent_le_Var_div` at the relative density, whose mean is `1`, gives
the comparison of divergences.  This is where the module pays for itself: it
makes every χ² estimate in the library an estimate in relative entropy. -/

/-- **The KL divergence is at most the χ²-divergence**, `D_KL(ν ‖ μ) ≤ D_{χ²}(ν ‖ μ)`.

This is `Ent_le_Var_div` at `f = ν/μ`, whose `μ`-mean is `1` under absolute
continuity (`Ex_relDensity`), so the division by the mean is invisible.

The inequality is one-way and strict in general — `χ²` is a quadratic quantity
and `D_KL` a linear one — which is exactly why the entropy method is the sharper
of the two.  Used in the other direction it upgrades `chiSq_iter_le` and
everything downstream of it to relative entropy at no cost. -/

/-! ## An aside: the homogeneity-corrected Dirichlet bound

`naiveModLogSobolev_le_zero` shows that `ρ · Ent_μ(f) ≤ ℰ_P(f, f)` is vacuous,
because `Ent` is `1`-homogeneous and `ℰ_P(f, f)` is `2`-homogeneous.  It is worth
recording that the defect is entirely in the *pairing*: dividing the Dirichlet
form by `μ(f)` restores homogeneity, and the resulting inequality then holds
unconditionally with the Poincaré constant, by `Ent_le_Var_div`.

This is *not* a modified log-Sobolev inequality — `ModLogSobolev` pairs `Ent`
with the entropy production `ℰ_P(f, log f)`, and nothing here produces entropy
*decay* along the chain.  It is a sanity check that the Dirichlet form is not
itself the problem. -/

/-- **The correctly homogeneous Dirichlet-form bound on entropy.**  If `P` has
spectral gap at least `γ > 0` with respect to `μ`, then for every `f ≥ 0` of
positive mean

  `Ent_μ(f) ≤ ℰ_P(f, f) / (γ · μ(f))`.

Both sides are `1`-homogeneous: replacing `f` by `c f` multiplies `Ent` by `c`,
`ℰ_P(f, f)` by `c²` and `μ(f)` by `c`.  Contrast `NaiveModLogSobolev`, which
omits the `μ(f)` and is thereby vacuous (`naiveModLogSobolev_le_zero`).

The proof is `Ent_le_Var_div` composed with the Poincaré inequality; the content
is entirely in the first factor. -/

/-! ## Cashing the payoff: entropy mixing bounds

`Techniques.MixingTime` proves the χ²-divergence of the `t`-step law from a
deterministic start decays geometrically, and converts that into a total
variation mixing time.  Composing with `klDiv_le_chiSq` gives the same
statements for the relative entropy, which is the currency the optimal-mixing
literature uses.

To be clear about what is and is not gained: the *rate* here is still the `L²`
rate, and the `1/μ_min` in the initial divergence is still the `L²` one.  The
entropy method's advantage — replacing `log(1/μ_min)` by `log log(1/μ_min)` —
comes from decaying `Ent` directly under a modified log-Sobolev inequality, not
from this comparison.  What these theorems buy is that every existing bound is
now *stated* in relative entropy, so an entropy-decay argument can be dropped in
later without restating the interface. -/

The exponential inversion is the same one-liner as in `mixesWithin_of_log_le`,
`c ≤ exp(c − 1)`, squared because the χ²-divergence contracts by `c²` a step.
The logarithm carries `1/m` where `mixesWithin_of_log_le` carries `1/√m`, but the
prefactor is `2(1 − c)` rather than `(1 − c)`, so the coefficient of
`log(1/μ_min)` in the resulting mixing time is the *same* `(1 − c)⁻¹` as in the

/-- **Relative entropy decay for the lazy chain, from the Poincaré constant.**
The entropy analogue of `tvDist_iter_row_lazy_le`:

  `D_KL(P_lazy^t(x, ·) ‖ μ) ≤ (1 − γ/2)^{2t} · (1/μ(x) − 1)`.

No ergodicity hypothesis, no aperiodicity hypothesis, and no eigenvalue. -/

/-- **The entropy mixing-time bound** — the entropy analogue of
`mixesWithin_lazy_of_gap`, and the point of this module.

Let `P` be reversible with respect to `μ`, let `μ` be bounded below by `m > 0`,
and let `P` satisfy the Poincaré inequality with constant `γ ≤ 2`.  Then the
lazy chain satisfies

  `D_KL(P_lazy^t(x, ·) ‖ μ) ≤ ε`  for every start `x`,

as soon as `ln (1 / (ε m)) ≤ γ · t`, i.e. after `t ≥ γ⁻¹ ln(1/(ε m))` steps.

Every hypothesis is one the library already supplies for concrete chains (see
`Chains/Glauber.lean`), so this is immediately instantiable; and the conclusion
is in the divergence that the optimal-mixing arguments of the monograph
manipulate. -/
