# Couplings and the coupling inequality

Total variation distance is defined by a sum over the state space, which makes it
awkward to bound directly: to show two distributions are close one has to control
`∑ x, |μ x - ν x|` term by term.  A *coupling* replaces that computation by a
construction.  One exhibits a single distribution on `Ω × Ω` whose two marginals
are `μ` and `ν`, and then the probability that the two coordinates *disagree* is
an upper bound for the distance.  Since one is free to choose the joint
distribution, this converts an analytic estimate into a combinatorial one: build
a pair of coupled runs of the chain and count how often they differ.

This is the standard alternative to spectral methods for proving rapid mixing,
it is entirely elementary, and — in keeping with §1.2 of the roadmap — it does
not touch spectral notions at all.  It gives the `Chains/` modules a second,
independent route to a mixing bound alongside the Poincaré inequality.

* `Coupling μ ν` — a joint distribution on `Ω × Ω` with marginals `μ` and `ν`.
* `Coupling.indep` — the independent (product) coupling, so the notion is never
  vacuous; `Coupling.symm` — a coupling of `μ` and `ν` read backwards.
* `Coupling.disagree` — the probability that the two coordinates differ, with
  `disagree_nonneg` and `disagree_le_one`.
* `Coupling.Pr_sub_le_disagree` — for *every* event `S`, `μ(S) - ν(S)` is at most
  the disagreement probability (the joint mass of the rectangle `S × Sᶜ`).
* `Coupling.tvDist_le` — the **coupling inequality** `‖μ - ν‖_TV ≤ P[X ≠ Y]`,
  obtained by feeding the event characterisation `tvDist_eq_Pr_sub` into the
  previous item.
* `maximalCoupling` and `maximalCoupling_disagree` — the bound is **tight**: the
  coupling that puts mass `min (μ x) (ν x)` on the diagonal and distributes the
  remainder as a normalised product of positive parts attains equality, so
  `‖μ - ν‖_TV = min over couplings of P[X ≠ Y]`
  (`exists_coupling_disagree_eq_tvDist`).
* `exists_coupling_disagree_eq_zero_iff` — a coupling with zero disagreement
  exists exactly when `μ = ν`.

Everything here is proved from first principles with no `sorry`.

`X ∼ μ` and `Y ∼ ν`, with no constraint on how the two are correlated. -/

/-- No event separates `μ` from `ν` by more than the disagreement probability of
any coupling.  The proof is the whole content of the coupling inequality: both
`μ(S)` and `ν(S)` are joint masses of rectangles, `S ×ˢ univ` and `univ ×ˢ S`,
which share the square `S ×ˢ S`; the difference is therefore the mass of
`S ×ˢ Sᶜ` minus that of `Sᶜ ×ˢ S`, and every pair in `S ×ˢ Sᶜ` disagrees. -/
