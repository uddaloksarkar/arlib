# Mixing time from the spectral gap

Everything in `Arlib.MarkovChains.Techniques` so far measures convergence in
`L²(μ)`: the spectral gap makes `Var_μ(P^t f)` and `D_{χ²}(ν P^t ‖ μ)` decay
geometrically.  What a sampling algorithm needs instead is a *uniform over
starting states* bound in total variation, and this module supplies the missing
link.  It is the formal counterpart of §3.5 of Chen–Štefankovič–Vigoda, the
place where the analysis becomes an algorithmic guarantee.

The chain of reasoning is short because every analytic ingredient is already in
place.  Starting the chain at a state `x` means pushing forward the point mass
`δ_x`, whose χ²-divergence from `μ` is exactly `1/μ(x) - 1`; the χ²-divergence
contracts by `c²` per step; and Cauchy–Schwarz converts χ² into total variation.
The only genuinely new work is the arithmetic that turns `c^t` into a condition
on `t`.

* `FinDist.dirac` and `FinKernel.push_dirac` (both in `Techniques.Chain`) — the
  point mass, and the bridge
  `K.push δ_x = K.row x` between the `push`-phrased χ² machinery and the
  `row`-phrased `MixesWithin`.
* `chiSq_dirac` — `D_{χ²}(δ_x ‖ μ) = 1/μ(x) - 1`: the worst-case initial
  divergence, and the only place `μ(x)` enters the final bound.
* `chiSq_iter_le` — the iterated form of `chiSq_push_le`:
  `D_{χ²}(ν P^t ‖ μ) ≤ (c²)^t D_{χ²}(ν ‖ μ)`.
* `tvDist_iter_row_le` — **the mixing bound**:
  `‖P^t(x, ·) - μ‖_TV ≤ ½ c^t √(1/μ(x) - 1)`.
* `mixesWithin_of_bound`, `mixesWithin_of_log_le` — the same statement against
  `MixesWithin`, the second with an explicit sufficient condition on `t`.
* `tvDist_iter_row_lazy_le`, `mixesWithin_lazy_of_gap` — the user-facing form,
  stated in terms of the Poincaré constant `γ` rather than the absolute spectral
  bound: the lazy version of any reversible chain with spectral gap at least `γ`
  is `ε`-mixed once `(γ/2) · t ≥ ln(1 / (2 ε √μ_min))`.

No eigenvalue appears anywhere, here or upstream.  Everything here is proved
from first principles with no `sorry`.

/-! ## The mixing bound -/

/-- **Mixing time from the spectral gap.**  For a chain `P` reversible with
respect to a fully supported `μ` and obeying the absolute spectral bound
`c ≥ 0`, the law after `t` steps started at `x` satisfies

  `‖P^t(x, ·) - μ‖_TV ≤ ½ · c^t · √(1/μ(x) - 1)`.

Three facts combine: the initial χ²-divergence from a point start is
`1/μ(x) - 1` (`chiSq_dirac`), the χ²-divergence contracts by `c²` per step
(`chiSq_iter_le`), and total variation is controlled by the square root of the
χ²-divergence (`tvDist_le_sqrt_chiSq`). -/

/-! ## Stated against `MixesWithin` -/

`tvDist_iter_row_le` is at most `ε` at every state, the chain is `ε`-mixed after
`t` steps. -/

/-- **An explicit mixing time.**  If `μ` is bounded below by `m > 0` and the
absolute spectral bound is `c ∈ [0, 1]`, then the chain is `ε`-mixed after `t`
steps as soon as

  `ln (1 / (2 ε √m)) ≤ (1 - c) · t`,

i.e. after `t ≥ (1 - c)⁻¹ ln(1 / (2 ε √m))` steps.  This is the
`Tmix(ε) ≤ γ⁻¹ ln(1 / (ε √μ_min))` bound of the monograph, with the constants
that the elementary route actually delivers.

The exponential inversion is the one-line inequality `c ≤ exp(c - 1)`
(`Real.add_one_le_exp`), raised to the `t`-th power; no logarithm of `c` is
taken, so no lower bound on `c` is needed. -/

/-! ## The user-facing form: mixing from a Poincaré constant

A general reversible chain need not converge at all — a bipartite chain
alternates forever — so the Poincaré inequality alone cannot bound the mixing
time.  Laziness repairs this (`lazy_nonnegDefinite`) at the cost of exactly a
factor two in the gap, and the resulting statement mentions only `γ`. -/

/-- **Mixing of the lazy chain from the Poincaré constant.**  For any chain `P`
reversible with respect to a fully supported `μ` and satisfying the Poincaré
inequality with constant `γ ≤ 2`,

  `‖P_lazy^t(x, ·) - μ‖_TV ≤ ½ (1 - γ/2)^t √(1/μ(x) - 1)`.

No ergodicity hypothesis, no aperiodicity hypothesis, and no eigenvalue. -/

`μ` be bounded below by `m > 0`, and let `P` satisfy the Poincaré inequality
with constant `γ ≤ 2`.  Then the lazy chain `P_lazy` is `ε`-mixed after `t`
steps whenever

  `ln (1 / (2 ε √m)) ≤ (γ/2) · t`,

that is, after `t ≥ (2/γ) · ln(1 / (2 ε √m))` steps.  Compare
`main.tex` §3.5: the monograph's `Tmix ≤ (2γ)⁻¹ ln(4/μ*)` differs only in
constants, the factor two coming from laziness. -/
