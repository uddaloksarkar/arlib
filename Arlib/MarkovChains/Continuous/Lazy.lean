# Lazy kernels on a general state space

The **lazy** version of a Markov kernel holds in place with probability `½` and otherwise
takes one step of `κ`:

  `lazy κ x = ½ · δ_x + ½ · κ x`.

This is the measure-theoretic analogue of `Arlib.MarkovChains.FinChain.lazy`, which builds
`½(I + P)` on a finite state space.

## Why laziness

A conductance bound on its own says nothing about mixing: the two-state chain that swaps
deterministically has conductance `1` and never converges, because it is periodic. Laziness
is the standard surgery that removes periodicity — `lazy κ` puts mass `½` on staying put,
so the transition operator can no longer have `-1` in its spectrum — and it is what makes a
Cheeger-type bound convertible into a mixing-time bound at all. Every analysis of a geometric
random walk (ball walk, hit-and-run) is carried out for the lazy chain for exactly this
reason, and pays for it with the factor of two recorded in `cut_lazy` and
`lazy_spectralGapAtLeast` below.

## Main definitions

* `Arlib.Kernel.lazy` — the kernel `x ↦ ½ δ_x + ½ κ x`.

## Main results

* `Arlib.Kernel.isMarkovKernel_lazy` — `lazy κ` is again a Markov kernel.
* `Arlib.Kernel.flow_lazy` — `flow μ (lazy κ) A B = ½ μ (A ∩ B) + ½ flow μ κ A B`.
* `Arlib.Kernel.cut_lazy` — `cut μ (lazy κ) A = ½ cut μ κ A`: the holding part never leaves
  `A`, so it contributes nothing to the cut and laziness halves it exactly.
* `Arlib.Kernel.conductance_lazy` — hence `Φ_{lazy κ}(A) = ½ Φ_κ(A)`.
* `Arlib.Kernel.lazy_reversible`, `Arlib.Kernel.lazy_invariant` — laziness preserves both
  standing hypotheses.
* `Arlib.Kernel.dirichlet_lazy` — the Dirichlet form is halved, hence
  `Arlib.Kernel.lazy_spectralGapAtLeast`: a Poincaré constant `γ` for `κ` becomes `γ/2` for
  `lazy κ`. `Arlib.Kernel.lazy_spectralGapAtLeast_iff` records that nothing is lost, so a gap
  proved for the lazy chain reads back as a gap for the original.

## Scope

Hypotheses that are invisible in the finite analogue and are genuinely needed here:

* `flow_lazy` requires the **target** `B` to be measurable, and `cut_lazy` therefore requires
  `A` to be. On a `Fintype` every set is measurable; here `δ_x B` is only pinned down by
  `Measure.dirac_apply'` when `B` is. (The *source* set of a flow need not be measurable —
  it only restricts the outer integral — which is why `flow_lazy` takes one hypothesis and
  not two.)
* Conversely, `cut_lazy`, `conductance_lazy`, `lazy_reversible` and `lazy_invariant` need
  **no** `IsMarkovKernel` hypothesis, unlike `cut_le` and its relatives in
  `Arlib.MarkovChains.Continuous.Flow`. Halving the cut is a statement about where the
  holding mass goes, not about conservation of mass.

Everything is stated exactly as one would guess from the finite case; no statement had to be
weakened or corrected.

Not proved here: any mixing-time bound. Turning `lazy_spectralGapAtLeast` into a bound on
total variation distance is downstream work. Positive semidefiniteness, which is the point of
the finite `Arlib.MarkovChains.Techniques.Lazy`, has no counterpart in this file, because the
`ℝ≥0∞`-valued development of `Arlib.MarkovChains.Continuous.SpectralGap` carries no signed
inner product to be definite about; the halving of the Dirichlet form is stated directly
instead.

/-- The **lazy version** of a kernel: `lazy κ x = ½ δ_x + ½ κ x`, which holds at `x` with
probability `½` and otherwise takes one step of `κ`.

Built by hand from `toFun` together with a measurability proof: `ProbabilityTheory.Kernel`
carries an `Add` instance but no `ℝ≥0∞`-scalar action, so the `½ •` is applied at the level
of measures. -/

`A` and `B` already overlap, so

  `flow μ (lazy κ) A B = ½ μ (A ∩ B) + ½ flow μ κ A B`.

Only the *target* `B` needs to be measurable; see the module docstring. -/

/-- **Laziness halves the cut exactly.**

  `cut μ (lazy κ) A = ½ cut μ κ A`.

The holding half of the kernel never leaves `A`, so it contributes `μ (A ∩ Aᶜ) = 0` to the
flow across the boundary; only the moving half, weighted by `½`, escapes.

This is where the factor of two in every lazy-chain mixing bound comes from. Note that no
`IsMarkovKernel` hypothesis is needed. -/

Immediate from `cut_lazy`, since the normalisation `μ A` is untouched. -/

pushes the other half through `κ`, which returns `μ`; the two halves reassemble.

No `IsMarkovKernel` hypothesis is required. -/

/-! ## The Dirichlet form and the spectral gap -/

/-- A function vanishing at `x` has zero lower integral against `δ_x`, with **no**
measurability hypothesis: every measurable simple minorant is bounded at `x` by the value of
the function there, namely `0`.

This is what lets `dirichlet_lazy` be stated for arbitrary `f : Ω → ℝ`, matching
`Arlib.Kernel.SpectralGapAtLeast`, which quantifies over all real functions. -/

/-- **Laziness halves the Dirichlet form**: `ℰ_{lazy κ}(f) = ½ ℰ_κ(f)`.

The holding half contributes `(f x − f x)² = 0` to the pair form, so only the moving half
survives, weighted by `½`. Holds for every `f : Ω → ℝ`, measurable or not. -/

/-- **Laziness halves the spectral gap.** A Poincaré constant `γ` for `κ` yields the constant
`γ/2` for `lazy κ`: the variance is untouched and the Dirichlet form is halved.

This is the quantitative cost of removing periodicity, and the reason mixing-time bounds for
lazy walks carry a factor of two. -/

/-- **The halving loses nothing.** `lazy κ` has Poincaré constant at least `γ/2` exactly when
`κ` has Poincaré constant at least `γ`, so a gap proved for the lazy chain can be read back as
a gap for the original.

The forward direction cancels the finite nonzero factor `½` from both sides. -/
