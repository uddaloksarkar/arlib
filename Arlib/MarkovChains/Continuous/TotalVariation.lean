# Total variation distance on a general state space

A sampler for a continuous distribution — a ball walk on a convex body, hit-and-run,
Metropolis on `ℝⁿ` — never returns an exact draw from its target. It returns a draw from
whatever law the chain has reached after finitely many steps. Every downstream statement
about such a sampler is therefore a statement about a measure that is merely *close* to the
target, and "close" has to mean something. Total variation distance is what it means: it is
the unique notion under which a bound on the sampler transfers, with no loss, to a bound on
the probability of **any** measurable event the caller cares about. That transfer is
`Arlib.Kernel.TVLe.measure_le_add`, and it is the reason this file exists.

Mathlib v4.15 has no total variation API for measures — only the Jordan decomposition of a
*signed* measure, from which one could extract `‖μ - ν‖` at the cost of dragging signed
measures through every statement. This file avoids that entirely.

## The bounded form

The distance is not defined. What is defined is the predicate

  `TVLe μ ν ε  ↔  ∀ measurable S, μ S ≤ ν S + ε ∧ ν S ≤ μ S + ε`,

read as "the total variation distance between `μ` and `ν` is at most `ε`". This is the
form every consumer wants — nobody uses the exact distance, they use a bound on it — and
carrying the bound rather than a `sSup` means no supremum bookkeeping: no `le_csSup`
side conditions, no nonemptiness hypotheses, and the metric-space laws below are one-line
consequences of `add_le_add` instead of arguments about suprema.

Everything is valued in `ℝ≥0∞`, consistent with `Arlib.MarkovChains.Continuous.Flow`. In
particular `ε = ⊤` is allowed and is vacuously true (`tvLe_top`), and the triangle
inequality needs no finiteness hypothesis.

Note the convention: with this definition `TVLe μ ν ε` bounds the *unnormalised* quantity
`sup_S |μ S - ν S|`, which for probability measures is the `d_TV` of
`Arlib.MarkovChains.Techniques.TotalVariation`, i.e. **half** the `L¹` distance.

## Scope

This is a foundational layer and deliberately thin. What is **not** proved here:

* No `sSup` definition of the distance itself, and hence no theorem that `TVLe` is
  equivalent to a bound on such a definition. There is nothing deep in this — it is
  omitted because nothing needs it.
* No data-processing inequality for a Markov *kernel*: `TVLe μ ν ε → TVLe (μ.bind κ)
  (ν.bind κ) ε`. Only the deterministic case `TVLe.map` is here. The kernel case needs a
  layer-cake argument to move the set-wise bound past a lower integral, which is a genuine
  proof and not attempted.
* No coupling characterisation (TV distance = minimum disagreement probability), no
  Pinsker inequality, and no link to a density or to the Jordan decomposition. The finite
  analogues live in `Arlib.MarkovChains.Techniques.Coupling` and
  `Arlib.MarkovChains.Techniques.Pinsker`.
* No mixing time: nothing here converts a spectral gap or a conductance bound into a
  `TVLe`. That is the theorem this file is the target of, not a theorem it contains.

## Main definitions

* `Arlib.Kernel.TVLe` — `μ` and `ν` are within total variation distance `ε`.

## Main results

* `Arlib.Kernel.TVLe.measure_le_add` — the transfer lemma: a bound on an event under `ν`
  becomes a bound under `μ`, degraded by exactly `ε`. This is the point of the file.
* `Arlib.Kernel.TVLe.refl`, `Arlib.Kernel.TVLe.symm`, `Arlib.Kernel.TVLe.trans`,
  `Arlib.Kernel.TVLe.mono` — the pseudometric laws, `TVLe` being reflexive at `0`,
  symmetric, and satisfying the triangle inequality `ε + δ`.
* `Arlib.Kernel.TVLe.eq_of_zero` — `TVLe μ ν 0` forces `μ = ν`, so the pseudometric
  separates points.
* `Arlib.Kernel.tvLe_of_forall_le` — for probability measures the one-sided bound already
  gives the two-sided one, by complementation.
* `Arlib.Kernel.TVLe.map` — the deterministic data-processing inequality: pushing both
  measures forward along a measurable map cannot increase the distance.

/-! ## Transferring a bound on an event

The reason the whole notion is worth having: a probability computed for the *target* is
still valid for whatever the sampler actually produced, degraded by exactly the sampler's
error. -/

/-- **Transfer of an upper bound.** If `μ` is within `ε` of `ν` and the event `S` is rare
under `ν`, it is rare under `μ` too, with the probability inflated by `ε`.

This is the lemma a sampler's caller uses: `ν` is the target, `μ` is the law of the
approximate sample, `p` is whatever failure probability the analysis of the target
established. -/

/-- Transfer in the other direction, for convenience: a bound established for `μ` transfers
to `ν`. Just `TVLe.measure_le_add` applied to the symmetric statement. -/

    ν S ≤ p + ε :=

/-! ## Probability measures -/

/-- **For probability measures one inequality suffices.** Applying the hypothesis to `Sᶜ`
and cancelling the (finite) mass `ν Sᶜ` recovers the reverse bound, so there is no need to
check both directions by hand. -/

already quantifies over all measurable sets, but worth recording so that callers holding a

/-! ## Data processing, deterministic case -/

/-- **Post-processing cannot increase the distance.** Pushing both measures forward along
a measurable map `f` — reporting `f x` instead of the sample `x` — preserves the bound.

The corresponding statement for a Markov kernel in place of `f` is true but is not proved
here; see the module docstring. -/
