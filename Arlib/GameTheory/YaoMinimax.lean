# Yao's minimax principle (averaging direction)

Fix a finite set of inputs `I`, a finite set of deterministic algorithms `D`, and
a cost function `cost : I → D → ℝ` (for instance the number of queries, or an
error indicator).  A *randomized algorithm* is a probability distribution `r` on
`D`, and an *input distribution* is a probability distribution `Γ` on `I`.

Yao's minimax principle states that the worst-case cost of the best randomized
algorithm equals the best-case cost of the best deterministic algorithm against
the worst input distribution.  The full statement is an application of von
Neumann's minimax theorem and requires both directions.

**Only the "easy" (averaging) direction is formalized here**, namely
`Arlib.yao_minimax`:

> if *every* deterministic algorithm `d` has `Γ`-average cost at least `c`, then
> *every* randomized algorithm `r` has cost at least `c` on *some* input.

This is the direction that lower-bound arguments actually use: to lower bound
the worst-case cost (or error probability) of an arbitrary randomized algorithm,
it suffices to exhibit a single input distribution `Γ` under which every
deterministic algorithm has average cost at least `c`.  No minimax theorem, no
compactness, and no LP duality is needed — the whole content is the exchange of
the two finite sums, isolated here as `Arlib.sum_gamma_sum_r_comm`, together
with the observation that a weighted average never exceeds its maximum.

## Main results

* `Arlib.sum_gamma_sum_r_comm` : `∑ x, Γ x * (∑ d, r d * cost x d)`
  `= ∑ d, r d * (∑ x, Γ x * cost x d)`, i.e. the `Γ`-average of the randomized
  cost is the `r`-average of the deterministic average costs.
* `Arlib.yao_minimax` : the averaging direction of Yao's minimax principle.
